# Value Stream Stages Configuration
# Defines stages for tracking work items from idea to production

stages:
  - name: Backlog
    type: wait
    order: 1
    wip_limit: null  # No limit for backlog
    description: >
      Work items waiting to be analyzed and prioritized.
      Items enter the value stream here before being pulled into active work.
    
  - name: Design
    type: active
    order: 2
    wip_limit: 5
    description: >
      Active design and analysis phase where requirements are refined,
      architecture is designed, and implementation approach is planned.
      Includes creating design documents, user stories, and acceptance criteria.
    
  - name: Development
    type: active
    order: 3
    wip_limit: 10
    description: >
      Active implementation phase where code is written, unit tests are created,
      and features are implemented according to design specifications.
      Developers work on assigned work items in this stage.
    
  - name: Code Review
    type: wait
    order: 4
    wip_limit: 8
    description: >
      Work items waiting for peer review. Code changes are reviewed for quality,
      security, maintainability, and adherence to standards. This is a wait state
      while reviewers provide feedback.
    
  - name: Testing
    type: active
    order: 5
    wip_limit: 8
    description: >
      Active testing phase including integration testing, acceptance testing,
      and quality assurance. QA team validates functionality against requirements
      and identifies any defects.
    
  - name: Deployment Approval
    type: wait
    order: 6
    wip_limit: 5
    description: >
      Work items waiting for deployment approval from stakeholders or release managers.
      This gate ensures proper change management and coordination before production deployment.
    
  - name: Deploy
    type: active
    order: 7
    wip_limit: 3
    description: >
      Active deployment phase where changes are rolled out to production.
      Includes deployment execution, smoke testing, and initial monitoring
      to ensure successful release.
    
  - name: Production
    type: done
    order: 8
    wip_limit: null  # No limit for completed items
    description: >
      Work items successfully deployed and running in production.
      This is the final stage indicating value delivery to end users.
      Items in this stage contribute to throughput metrics.

# Stage type definitions:
# - wait: Items are idle, waiting for someone else (increases lead time)
# - active: Items are being actively worked on (increases cycle time)
# - done: Items are completed and delivered (no longer in WIP)

# WIP (Work In Progress) limits:
# - Prevents overloading teams and reduces multitasking
# - Forces flow and identifies bottlenecks
# - null means no limit (typically for Backlog and Production)
# - Lower limits for deployment stages to control risk
