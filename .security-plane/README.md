> **Comprehensive, repository-agnostic security framework for the Fawkes Internal Developer Platform**

The Fawkes Security Plane provides automated security scanning, SBOM generation, image signing, and policy enforcement that can be adopted by any repository, existing or new.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Copy Security Plane Files

```bash
# From your repository root
mkdir -p .security-plane
cp -r /path/to/fawkes/.security-plane/* .security-plane/
```

### 2. Add Security Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/security.yml`:

```yaml
name: Security Checks

on: [push, pull_request]

permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write
  packages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  security:
    uses: paruff/fawkes/.github/workflows/security-plane-adoption.yml@main
    with:
      enforcement-mode: advisory
      enable-sbom: true
      enable-signing: false
```

### 3. Run Your First Scan

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add security plane"
git push
```

✅ Security scans will run automatically on every push and pull request!

### OPA/Rego Policies

- **Kubernetes Security** - Non-root containers, resource limits, security contexts
- **Dockerfile Best Practices** - No root user, specific versions, health checks
- **Supply Chain Security** - SBOM presence, image signatures, vulnerability blocking

### Security Tools

- 🔍 **Gitleaks** - Secret scanning
- 🛡️ **Trivy** - Vulnerability scanning
- 📦 **Syft** - SBOM generation
- ✍️ **Cosign** - Image signing
- 🏛️ **Conftest** - Policy enforcement

### Templates & Examples

- Onboarding PR template
- Issue templates for remediation

## 🎯 Features

### Security Scanning

✅ **Secret Detection**

- Gitleaks scans for hardcoded credentials
- Patterns for API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys
- Pre-commit hooks prevent secrets from being committed

✅ **Vulnerability Scanning**

- Trivy scans containers, filesystems, and dependencies
- CVE database checks
- Severity reporting: UNKNOWN, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL

✅ **Dependency Scanning**

- npm audit for Node.js
- safety for Python
- Built-in scanning for Go, Java, Rust

### SBOM Generation

✅ **Software Bill of Materials**

- Generated with Syft
- CycloneDX and SPDX formats
- Uploaded as GitHub artifacts
- 90-day retention

### Image Signing

✅ **Cryptographic Signatures**

- Keyless signing with Cosign/Sigstore
- OIDC authentication
- SBOM attestations
- Signature verification in CI

### Policy Enforcement

✅ **Policy as Code**

- OPA/Rego policies
- Kubernetes security best practices
- Dockerfile hardening rules
- Supply chain requirements

## 📊 Adoption Modes

### 🟢 Advisory Mode (Recommended for Start)

**Best for**: Initial adoption, understanding security posture

```yaml
enforcement-mode: advisory
fail-on-critical: false
```

✅ Scans run but don't block
✅ Visibility into issues
❌ No PR blocking

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks

### 🟡 Progressive Mode

**Best for**: Gradual security improvement

```yaml
enforcement-mode: strict
fail-on-critical: true
severity-threshold: CRITICAL
```

❌ Block CRITICAL vulnerabilities
⚠️ Warn on HIGH/MEDIUM
✅ Progressive enforcement

**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks after advisory

### 🔴 Strict Mode (Production)

**Best for**: Production-ready repositories

```yaml
enforcement-mode: strict
fail-on-critical: true
fail-on-violation: true
enable-signing: true
enable-sbom: true
```

❌ Block all policy violations
❌ Block MEDIUM+ vulnerabilities
✅ Require signed images
✅ Require SBOMs

**Timeline**: 4-8 weeks after progressive

## 🛠️ Customization

### Add Custom Policies

Create `.security-plane/policies/custom.rego`:

```rego
package main

deny[msg] {
    input.kind == "Deployment"
    not input.metadata.labels["team"]
    msg := "All deployments must have a 'team' label"
}
```

### Configure Exemptions

Create `.security-plane/exemptions.yaml`:

```yaml
vulnerabilities:
  - cve: CVE-2023-12345
    reason: "False positive - not exploitable"
    expires: "2024-12-31"

policies:
  - path: "test/**"
    policy: "require-resource-limits"
    reason: "Test resources don't need limits"
```

### Add Custom Scanners

Extend workflows with additional tools:

```yaml
jobs:
  custom-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run custom scanner
        run: ./scripts/custom-security-scan.sh
```

## 📈 Metrics & Monitoring

### Security Metrics Tracked

- Number of vulnerabilities (by severity)
- Policy violations (by type)
- Mean time to remediation (MTTR)
- % of repos with security plane enabled
- % of images signed
- SBOM coverage

### Integration with DORA Metrics

The Security Plane supports elite DORA metrics:

- **Deployment Frequency**: No security blocking delays
- **Lead Time**: Fast security feedback in PRs
- **Change Failure Rate**: Reduced by pre-deployment checks
- **Mean Time to Recovery**: Faster incident response with SBOMs

## 🔧 Integration

### Backstage

Security metrics in service catalog:

```yaml
# catalog-info.yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  annotations:
    security-plane/enabled: "true"
    security-plane/mode: "strict"
```

### Jenkins

Call from Jenkins pipelines:

```groovy
stage('Security Scan') {
    steps {
        sh 'gh workflow run security-plane-adoption.yml'
    }
}
```

### ArgoCD

Enforce policies before deployment:

```yaml
# argocd-application.yaml
spec:
  syncPolicy:
    syncOptions:
      - Validate=true
```
