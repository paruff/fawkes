A: Fawkes is currently an open-source project (MIT license) with a clear path to becoming a sustainable business through managed services, training, and enterprise support. We're at the pre-seed/bootstrapped stage.</p> <p>Q: Why should AWS give credits to an open-source project? A: Because every Fawkes deployment runs on AWS and drives AWS consumption. Our projected impact: 50+ organizations on AWS, $150K+/month AWS spend, 200+ engineers trained on AWS services. The $25K credit investment could drive $500K-1M+ in AWS revenue over 12 months.</p> <p>Q: What happens if you run out of credits before becoming profitable? A: We have a phased approach that validates value at each stage. If credits run out, we have contingency plans: migrate to lower-cost regions, apply for additional AWS programs, or customer deployments cover their own infrastructure. However, our financial projections show break-even by month 10-11.</p> <p>Q: How is Fawkes different from Backstage? A: Backstage is a developer portal (service catalog, docs). Fawkes is a complete platform that includes Backstage PLUS Jenkins, ArgoCD, Harbor, monitoring, GitOps workflows, automated DORA metrics, and most importantly, a comprehensive training system (Dojo). Backstage is one component of Fawkes.</p> <p>Q: Why not just use AWS Proton? A: AWS Proton is excellent but different use case. Proton is AWS-only and template-based. Fawkes is a complete IDP with broader scope (CI/CD, GitOps, training, community) and can deploy to any cloud. They solve different problems. We could integrate with Proton as one deployment option.</p> <p>Q: What's your long-term AWS commitment? A: AWS is our primary cloud partner. While we'll add multi-cloud support (Year 2+) for customer demand, AWS will remain our reference implementation, documentation focus, and strategic partnership priority. Our success directly drives AWS consumption.</p> <p>Q: How do you plan to make money from open source? A: Three revenue streams: (1) Managed service (hosted Fawkes), (2) Enterprise support contracts, (3) Training and certification. The open-source platform is forever free; we charge for convenience, support, and education. This model has proven successful for Red Hat, Databricks, HashiCorp, etc.</p> <p>Q: What if a competitor copies your work (it's open source)? A: That's the point of open source! But our competitive moat is: (1) Community and ecosystem (hard to replicate), (2) Dojo training system (unique differentiator), (3) AWS partnership and co-marketing, (4) First-mover advantage and brand recognition. The code is open, but the community and education ecosystem are our true assets.</p> <p>Q: How can you compete with funded startups? A: By staying lean and focused. Our LTV:CAC ratio (13:1) means we can scale profitably without venture funding. AWS Activate credits remove our biggest constraint (infrastructure costs). We're competing on value (free open source + training), not marketing budget.</p> <p>Q: What are the biggest risks? A: (1) Low adoption of open source, (2) Difficulty monetizing free users, (3) Competition from funded startups. Mitigations: (1) Heavy investment in docs and community, (2) Clear upgrade path (free \u2192 paid), (3) Our unique training moat. See full Risk Analysis section for details.</p> <p>Thank you for considering Fawkes for the AWS Activate program!</p> <p>We're excited about the opportunity to partner with AWS and build the future of platform engineering together.</p> <p>Ready to Execute \ud83d\ude80</p>"},{"location":"capabilities/","title":"DORA Capabilities","text":""},{"location":"capabilities/#fast-flow-capabilities","title":"Fast Flow Capabilities","text":""},{"location":"capabilities/#continuous-delivery","title":"Continuous Delivery","text":"<p>Enable teams to deploy software quickly and reliably using automated pipelines.</p> <p>Implementation: - Pattern: Continuous Delivery - Tools:   - Spinnaker   - Jenkins</p>"},{"location":"capabilities/#infrastructure-as-code","title":"Infrastructure as Code","text":"<p>Manage infrastructure through version-controlled declarative configurations.</p> <p>Implementation: - Pattern: Infrastructure as Code - Tools:   - Terraform   - Kubernetes</p>"},{"location":"capabilities/#feedback-and-continuous-improvement-capabilities","title":"Feedback and Continuous Improvement Capabilities","text":""},{"location":"capabilities/#monitoring-and-observability","title":"Monitoring and Observability","text":"<p>Implement comprehensive monitoring to ensure system health.</p> <p>Implementation: - Pattern: Monitoring and Observability - Tools:   - Prometheus   - Grafana</p>"},{"location":"capabilities/#test-automation","title":"Test Automation","text":"<p>Automate testing at all levels to catch issues early.</p> <p>Implementation: - Pattern: Test Automation - Tools:   - Selenium   - JUnit</p>"},{"location":"capabilities/#recovery-and-resilience-capabilities","title":"Recovery and Resilience Capabilities","text":""},{"location":"capabilities/#shift-left-on-security","title":"Shift Left on Security","text":"<p>Integrate security early in the development process.</p> <p>Implementation: - Pattern: Shift Left on Security - Tools:   - OWASP ZAP   - SonarQube</p>"},{"location":"capabilities/#change-failure-rate-reduction","title":"Change Failure Rate Reduction","text":"<p>Improve code quality to reduce production failures.</p> <p>Implementation: - Pattern: Change Failure Rate Reduction - Tools:   - SonarQube   - CodeClimate</p>"},{"location":"capabilities/#learning-and-innovation-capabilities","title":"Learning and Innovation Capabilities","text":""},{"location":"capabilities/#documentation-quality","title":"Documentation Quality","text":"<p>Maintain high-quality, accessible documentation.</p> <p>Implementation: - Pattern: Documentation Quality - Tools:   - MkDocs   - Docusaurus</p>"},{"location":"capabilities/#learning-culture","title":"Learning Culture","text":"<p>Foster continuous learning and improvement.</p> <p>Implementation: - Pattern: Learning Culture - Tools:   - Discourse   - Jupyter</p> <p>Explore Implementation Patterns View Tool Integrations</p>"},{"location":"configuration/","title":"Configuration","text":"<p>This document provides an overview of the configuration options for the Fawkes Internal Developer Platform.

(modular) - Native Helm support - Excellent multi-tenancy - Lower resource usage than ArgoCD - Strong automation capabilities - Good for Infrastructure as Code</p> <p>Cons: - No Built-In UI: CLI-only, requires separate UI (Weave GitOps) - Less Visual: No application topology graph like ArgoCD - Smaller Community: Fewer contributors and users than ArgoCD - Learning Curve: GitOps Toolkit concepts more abstract - Progressive Delivery: Requires Flagger (separate project) - Less Mature Backstage Plugin: ArgoCD plugin more feature-complete</p> <p>Reason for Rejection: Flux is excellent, but ArgoCD's UI is significant advantage for developer experience and troubleshooting. Visual application topology helps developers understand system. ArgoCD's larger community and more mature Backstage integration better fit Fawkes needs. However, Flux is valid choice and could be reconsidered for infrastructure GitOps.</p>"},{"location":"adr/ADR-003%20argocd/#alternative-2-jenkins-x","title":"Alternative 2: Jenkins X","text":"<p>Pros: - Complete CI/CD platform (not just CD) - GitOps-based - Automated preview environments - Integrated pipeline and deployment - Good for Jenkins users</p> <p>Cons: - Opinionated: Prescriptive workflows, less flexible - Complexity: Full platform, not just GitOps - Jenkins Dependency: Tied to Jenkins ecosystem - Smaller Adoption: Less proven than ArgoCD/Flux - Maintenance Concerns: Development pace slowed - Overkill: We already have Jenkins for CI</p> <p>Reason for Rejection: Jenkins X is full CI/CD platform, but we're using Jenkins (ADR-004) for CI and only need GitOps for CD. Jenkins X too opinionated and complex. ArgoCD's separation of concerns (CI vs CD) cleaner architecture.</p>"},{"location":"adr/ADR-003%20argocd/#alternative-3-spinnaker","title":"Alternative 3: Spinnaker","text":"<p>Pros: - Multi-cloud native (not just Kubernetes) - Advanced deployment strategies - Proven at Netflix scale - Strong pipeline orchestration - Multi-cluster management - Extensive integrations</p> <p>Cons: - Heavy and Complex: Difficult to deploy and maintain - Resource Intensive: Requires 8+ microservices, significant resources - Steep Learning Curve: Complex concepts and UI - Not GitOps-First: Push-based, not GitOps pull model - Maintenance Burden: High operational overhead - Overkill: More than we need for Kubernetes deployments</p> <p>Reason for Rejection: Spinnaker powerful but extremely complex. High resource usage (10+ pods) and maintenance burden unjustified for our Kubernetes-focused needs. Not GitOps-native (push model). ArgoCD provides 80% of benefits with 20% of complexity.

Cost at scale significant (100 builds/day \u00d7 10 min \u00d7 $0.008 = $240/month, $2,880/year just for CI). Self-hosted runners less mature than Jenkins Kubernetes agents.

Search: Not as robust as PostgreSQL - Fewer Advanced Features: Less support for CTEs, window functions - Fragmentation: MySQL (Oracle) vs. MariaDB (community) split - Less Cloud-Native: Kubernetes operators less mature</p> <p>Reason for Rejection: PostgreSQL's superior JSON support, full-text search, and advanced SQL features better fit Fawkes needs.

MySQL excellent database but PostgreSQL better alignment with cloud-native ecosystem.</p>"},{"location":"adr/ADR-006%20postgres/#alternative-2-mongodb","title":"Alternative 2: MongoDB","text":"<p>Pros: - Document-oriented (flexible schema) - Excellent for JSON data - Horizontal scaling built-in - High write throughput - Popular for modern applications</p> <p>Cons: - NoSQL: Not all components support MongoDB - No ACID Across Collections: Weak consistency by default - Limited Joins: Embedding vs. referencing trade-offs - Operational Complexity: Sharding complex to manage - Backstage Not Supported: Backstage requires SQL database - License Concerns: SSPL license controversial</p> <p>Reason for Rejection: MongoDB excellent for document storage but incompatible with key components (Backstage, SonarQube). ACID properties critical for catalog and metrics. SQL relationships important for service dependencies. PostgreSQL JSONB provides flexible schema when needed while maintaining SQL strengths.</p>"},{"location":"adr/ADR-006%20postgres/#alternative-3-sqlite","title":"Alternative 3: SQLite","text":"<p>Pros: - Zero configuration - No separate server process - Very lightweight - Fast for single-user scenarios - Embedded database</p> <p>Cons: - No Concurrency: Limited concurrent writes - No Network Access: File-based only - No Replication: No built-in HA - Not Kubernetes-Native: File-based doesn't fit pods well - Scalability Limits: Not designed for multi-user systems</p> <p>Reason for Rejection: SQLite excellent for local development and embedded use cases but not suitable for multi-user platform services.

Industry-standard for software teams - Extremely powerful and feature-rich - Extensive reporting and analytics - Huge marketplace of plugins (1,000+) - Advanced workflow engine - Time tracking,

Complexity: Notoriously complex, requires dedicated admin - Performance: Often slow, especially self-hosted - Vendor Lock-In: Proprietary data format, difficult to migrate - No Native Mattermost Integration: Requires custom webhooks - Heavy Resource Requirements: Self-hosted needs significant infrastructure - Not Open Source: Proprietary software, no source code access - Misaligned Values: Commercial SaaS doesn't align with open source platform</p> <p>Reason for Rejection: Cost is prohibitive for open source project (at 500 users: $46,500-$87,000/year). Complexity overkill for most teams. Self-hosted Data Center extremely expensive and complex to operate. No native Mattermost integration.

Designed for Kubernetes logging (cloud-native) - Very cost-efficient (indexes only metadata, not log content) - Tight Grafana integration (unified metrics + logs) - Simple deployment and operation - LogQL query language (similar to PromQL) -

Less suitable for compliance (long-term retention, complex queries) - Fewer visualization options in dashboards - Multi-tenancy requires Loki enterprise features</p> <p>Reason for Rejection: While Loki is excellent for operational logging, Fawkes requires robust full-text search for debugging, compliance auditing, and security investigations. OpenSearch's powerful query DSL and proven scalability better support DORA metrics analysis and incident post-mortems.

This is your first step toward becoming a platform engineer.\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nBy completing this module, you will be able to:\n\n1. **Define** what an Internal Delivery Platform (IDP) is\n2. **Explain** the difference between traditional infrastructure and platform engineering\n3. **Identify** key components of Fawkes platform\n4. **Describe** the business value and ROI of platform engineering\n5. **Deploy** your first application using Fawkes (hands-on lab)\n\n### Why This Matters\n\nPlatform engineering is one of the fastest-growing disciplines in technology.\nOrganizations with mature platforms:\n- Deploy **10x more frequently**\n- Have **50% lower change failure rates**\n- Recover from incidents **2x faster**\n- Save **30-40% in infrastructure costs**\n\n### DORA Capabilities Covered\n\nThis module teaches:\n- \u2705 **Version control** - Understanding Git-based workflows\n- \u2705 **Deployment automation** - Self-service deployment\n- \u2705 **Loosely coupled architecture** - Microservices patterns\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcda Section 1: What is an Internal Delivery Platform?\n\n### The Problem: Developer Cognitive Load\n\nImagine a developer starting a new microservice. Without a platform, they must:\n\n1. Provision infrastructure (AWS console, navigation hell)\n2. Set up CI/CD (write Jenkinsfile from scratch)\n3. Configure observability (Prometheus, Grafana, dashboards)\n4. Implement security (scanning tools, secrets management)\n5. Set up deployment (Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts)\n6. Configure networking (ingress, service mesh, DNS)\n7. Manage databases (provision, backup, migrations)\n8. Document everything (runbooks, architecture diagrams)\n\n**Result**: 2-4 weeks before writing application code. High error rate. Inconsistent implementations.\n\n### The Solution: Platform Engineering\n\n**Platform Engineering** treats infrastructure and tooling as a product for internal customers (developers).\n\n**Fawkes Platform** provides:\n- **Self-service capabilities** - Deploy via Backstage portal\n- **Golden paths** - Pre-configured, opinionated workflows\n- **Automation** - CI/CD, deployment, monitoring automated\n- **Standards** - Consistent security, observability, best practices\n- **Developer experience** - Simple, fast, delightful interface\n\n**Result**: Deploy new service in &lt;1 hour. Consistent quality. Developers focus on business logic.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Hands-On Lab: Deploy Your First Application\n\n### Lab Objectives\n\n- Use Backstage to create a new service from a template\n- Trigger an automated build in Jenkins\n- Deploy to development environment via ArgoCD\n- View DORA metrics for your deployment\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Access to Fawkes platform (provided by instructor)\n- GitHub account\n- Basic familiarity with command line\n\n### Step 1: Access Backstage\n\n1. Navigate to `https://backstage.fawkes-platform.local`\n2. Log in with your GitHub account\n3. You should see the Fawkes developer portal home page\n\n### Step 2: Create Service from Template\n\n1. Click \"Create\" in the left sidebar\n2. Select \"Java Spring Boot Microservice\" template\n3. Fill in the form:\n   - **Service Name**: `my-first-service`\n   - **Description**: \"Learning platform engineering with Fawkes\"\n   - **Owner**: (your name/team)\n4. Click \"Create\"\n5. Backstage will:\n   - Create GitHub repository\n   - Scaffold application code\n   - Configure Jenkins pipeline\n   - Set up ArgoCD application\n\n### Step 3: Observe the Build\n\n1. Click on \"View in Jenkins\" link\n2. Watch the pipeline execute:\n   - \u2705 Checkout code\n   - \u2705 Build with Maven\n   - \u2705 Run tests\n   - \u2705 Security scan (SonarQube, Trivy)\n   - \u2705 Build container image\n   - \u2705 Push to Harbor registry\n\n### Step 4: Monitor Deployment\n\n1. Click on \"View in ArgoCD\" link\n2. Watch ArgoCD sync your application:\n   - \u2705 Detects new image in registry\n   - \u2705 Updates Kubernetes manifests\n   - \u2705 Deploys to `dev` namespace\n   - \u2705 Runs health checks\n\n### Step 5: View DORA Metrics\n\n1. Navigate to Grafana dashboard: `https://grafana.fawkes-platform.local`\n2. Open \"DORA Metrics\" dashboard\n3. Find your service in the metrics:\n   - **Deployment Frequency**: 1 deployment recorded\n   - **Lead Time**: Time from template creation to deployment\n   - **Change Failure Rate**: 0% (successful deployment)\n\n### Step 6: Access Your Application\n\n1. Get the application URL from ArgoCD\n2. Visit `https://my-first-service.dev.fawkes-platform.local`\n3. You should see the Spring Boot welcome page!\n\n### Lab Complete! \ud83c\udf89\n\nCongratulations! You've:\n- \u2705 Created a service using a golden path template\n- \u2705 Triggered an automated CI/CD pipeline\n- \u2705 Deployed to Kubernetes via GitOps\n- \u2705 Generated DORA metrics automatically\n\n**Time to deployment:** ~10 minutes (vs. 2-4 weeks manually)\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcca Assessment\n\nTest your knowledge:\n\n1. What is an Internal Delivery Platform?\n2. Name three components of the Fawkes platform\n3. What are the Four Key DORA metrics?\n4.

hypothesize the following about the demand for a service that provides DORA metrics visualization:</p> <p>Hypothesis Statement:</p> <p>We believe that Improvement-Driven Leaders within software development organizations will find significant value in a service that provides easily accessible, objective visualization of DORA metrics.</p> <p>Because:</p> <ul> <li>DORA metrics (change lead time, deployment frequency, change fail percentage, failed deployment recovery time) are globally recognized and validated indicators of software delivery performance and overall organizational outcomes [6, 7].</li> <li>Improvement-Driven Leaders need objective data to understand the current state of their software delivery process and identify specific areas for improvement [5, 8].</li> <li>There is a common pain point where management doesn't fully understand the software process or the challenges faced by development and operations teams, leading to misaligned expectations and pressure [1-3].</li> <li>Providing end-to-end dashboards for stakeholders to view performance is a key practice for mitigating challenges and enabling data-driven decision-making [8].</li> <li>Metrics are a requirement for excellence and facilitate informed decision-making [8].</li> <li>Organizations often struggle to effectively collect and present these critical metrics from their existing toolchains [8, 14-16].</li> <li>A service focused on delivering these core metrics addresses a fundamental need for visibility and insight necessary for an improvement-driven approach [5, 7].</li> </ul> <p>Therefore:</p> <ul> <li>Providing a clear, centralized view of DORA metrics will solve a key pain point for leaders struggling to measure and understand their team's performance.</li> <li>This service will enable leaders to make better decisions, justify investments in process improvements, and communicate performance effectively across the organization.</li> <li>The demand for such a service is driven by the need to identify and address inefficiencies and bottlenecks in the software delivery lifecycle, ultimately helping organizations get \"better at getting better\" [5].</li> <li>While platforms like Backstage exist, a focused MVP on DORA metrics addresses the specific need for performance visibility directly, potentially with less initial overhead than a full IDP implementation, thus being valuable as a targeted solution for this persona.</li> </ul> <p>Validation Strategy (Implicit/Next Steps):</p> <ul> <li>Engage directly with potential customers (Improvement-Driven Leaders) to confirm these pain points and the perceived value of a DORA metrics dashboard [17].</li> <li>Leverage tools and methods for identifying pain points such as surveys, interviews, analyzing forum discussions (like on Reddit) related to DevOps, performance, and management challenges [17-26].</li> <li>Start with a DORA Quick Check style conversation [Conversation History] to assess current understanding and perceived needs regarding performance metrics.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"design/Jobs%20to%20Be%20Done%20%28JTBD%29%20for%20the%20Improve/","title":"Jobs to

Mandating usage creates resentment, and adding features may worsen the problem if they're not addressing real needs."},{"location":"dojo/modules/black-belt/module-17-platform-product/#question-7-success-metrics","title":"Question 7: Success Metrics","text":"<p>Which metric best indicates your platform is succeeding?</p> <p>A) Number of features shipped B) Infrastructure uptime percentage C) Improvement in DORA metrics for users D) Size of your platform team</p> Show Answer  **Answer: C**  The ultimate measure of platform success is whether it improves outcomes for your users.

New traffic patterns not tested\n   - Connection pool limits not validated\n\n2. **No Auto-Scaling**\n   - Manual configuration required\n   - Cannot adapt to traffic changes\n\n3. **Insufficient Monitoring**\n   - No alerting on connection pool utilization\n   - Detected via error rate, not proactive metric\n\n4. **Timing**\n   - Occurred during major promotional campaign\n   - Higher than normal traffic expected but not planned for\n\n---\n\n## What Went Well \u2705\n\n1. **Detection**: Automated alerts fired immediately (&lt; 1 min)\n2. **Communication**: Clear, frequent updates to stakeholders\n3. **Collaboration**: Team worked effectively under pressure\n4. **Documentation**: Excellent timeline kept by scribe\n5. **Resolution Speed**: 47 minutes well within SEV1 target (&lt; 2 hours)\n\n---\n\n## What Went Wrong \u274c\n\n1. **Prevention**: Inadequate load testing missed this scenario\n2. **Monitoring**: No proactive alert on connection pool usage\n3. **Capacity Planning**: Traffic spike predictable but not prepared for\n4. **Automation**: Manual scaling required human intervention\n5. **Documentation**: Connection pool limits not documented\n\n---\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Immediate (&lt; 1 week)\n\n| Action | Owner | Deadline | Status |\n|--------|-------|----------|--------|\n| Implement connection pool monitoring | @bob | Oct 15 | \u2705 Done |\n| Alert on 80% pool utilization | @carol | Oct 15 | \u2705 Done |\n| Document all database limits | @dave | Oct 16 | \ud83d\udd04 In Progress |\n\n### Short-term (&lt; 1 month)\n\n| Action | Owner | Deadline | Status |\n|--------|-------|----------|--------|\n| Implement auto-scaling for connection pool | @eve | Nov 1 | \ud83d\udccb Planned |\n| Load test with 2x expected traffic | @frank | Nov 5 | \ud83d\udccb Planned |\n| Create runbook for connection pool issues | @grace | Oct 25 | \ud83d\udd04 In Progress |\n\n### Long-term (&lt; 3 months)\n\n| Action | Owner | Deadline | Status |\n|--------|-------|----------|--------|\n| Implement chaos engineering for database | @henry | Dec 15 | \ud83d\udccb Planned |\n| Review all system capacity limits | @iris | Nov 30 | \ud83d\udccb Planned |\n| Enhance pre-launch checklist | @jack | Nov 15 | \ud83d\udccb Planned |\n\n---\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n1. **Load test everything**: Especially before major campaigns\n2. **Monitor resources, not just symptoms**: Alert before error rates spike\n3. **Plan for 3x capacity**: If expecting 2x traffic, plan for 3x\n4. **Automate recovery**: Manual scaling too slow for rapid incidents\n5. **Document limits**: Every system has limits -
