persona (Improvement-Driven Leader) and their Jobs to Be Done, we hypothesize the following about the demand for a service that provides DORA metrics visualization:</p> <p>Hypothesis Statement:</p> <p>We believe that Improvement-Driven Leaders within software development organizations will find significant value in a service that provides easily accessible, objective visualization of DORA metrics.</p> <p>Because:</p> <ul> <li>DORA metrics (change lead time, deployment frequency, change fail percentage, failed deployment recovery time) are globally recognized and validated indicators of software delivery performance and overall organizational outcomes [6, 7].</li> <li>Improvement-Driven Leaders need objective data to understand the current state of their software delivery process and identify specific areas for improvement [5, 8].</li> <li>There is a common pain point where management doesn't fully understand the software process or the challenges faced by development and operations teams, leading to misaligned expectations and pressure [1-3].</li> <li>Providing end-to-end dashboards for stakeholders to view performance is a key practice for mitigating challenges and enabling data-driven decision-making [8].</li> <li>Metrics are a requirement for excellence and facilitate informed decision-making [8].</li> <li>Organizations often struggle to effectively collect and present these critical metrics from their existing toolchains [8, 14-16].</li> <li>A service focused on delivering these core metrics addresses a fundamental need for visibility and insight necessary for an improvement-driven approach [5, 7].</li> </ul> <p>Therefore:</p> <ul> <li>Providing a clear, centralized view of DORA metrics will solve a key pain point for leaders struggling to measure and understand their team's performance.</li> <li>This service will enable leaders to make better decisions, justify investments in process improvements, and communicate performance effectively across the organization.</li> <li>The demand for such a service is driven by the need to identify and address inefficiencies and bottlenecks in the software delivery lifecycle, ultimately helping organizations get \"better at getting better\" [5].</li> <li>While platforms like Backstage exist, a focused MVP on DORA metrics addresses the specific need for performance visibility directly, potentially with less initial overhead than a full IDP implementation, thus being valuable as a targeted solution for this persona.</li> </ul> <p>Validation Strategy (Implicit/Next Steps):</p> <ul> <li>Engage directly with potential customers (Improvement-Driven Leaders) to confirm these pain points and the perceived value of a DORA metrics dashboard [17].</li> <li>Leverage tools and methods for identifying pain points such as surveys, interviews, analyzing forum discussions (like on Reddit) related to DevOps, performance, and management challenges [17-26].</li>
