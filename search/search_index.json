(modular) - Native Helm support - Excellent multi-tenancy - Lower resource usage than ArgoCD - Strong automation capabilities - Good for Infrastructure as Code</p> <p>Cons: - No Built-In UI: CLI-only, requires separate UI (Weave GitOps) - Less Visual: No application topology graph like ArgoCD - Smaller Community: Fewer contributors and users than ArgoCD - Learning Curve: GitOps Toolkit concepts more abstract - Progressive Delivery: Requires Flagger (separate project) - Less Mature Backstage Plugin: ArgoCD plugin more feature-complete</p> <p>Reason for Rejection: Flux is excellent, but ArgoCD's UI is significant advantage for developer experience and troubleshooting. Visual application topology helps developers understand system. ArgoCD's larger community and more mature Backstage integration better fit Fawkes needs. However, Flux is valid choice and could be reconsidered for infrastructure GitOps.</p>"},{"location":"adr/ADR-003%20argocd/#alternative-2-jenkins-x","title":"Alternative 2: Jenkins X","text":"<p>Pros: - Complete CI/CD platform (not just CD) - GitOps-based - Automated preview environments - Integrated pipeline and deployment - Good for Jenkins users</p> <p>Cons: - Opinionated: Prescriptive workflows, less flexible - Complexity: Full platform, not just GitOps - Jenkins Dependency: Tied to Jenkins ecosystem - Smaller Adoption: Less proven than ArgoCD/Flux - Maintenance Concerns: Development pace slowed - Overkill: We already have Jenkins for CI</p> <p>Reason for Rejection: Jenkins X is full CI/CD platform, but we're using Jenkins (ADR-004) for CI and only need GitOps for CD. Jenkins X too opinionated and complex. ArgoCD's separation of concerns (CI vs CD) cleaner architecture.</p>"},{"location":"adr/ADR-003%20argocd/#alternative-3-spinnaker","title":"Alternative 3: Spinnaker","text":"<p>Pros: - Multi-cloud native (not just Kubernetes) - Advanced deployment strategies - Proven at Netflix scale - Strong pipeline orchestration - Multi-cluster management - Extensive integrations</p> <p>Cons: - Heavy and Complex: Difficult to deploy and maintain - Resource Intensive: Requires 8+ microservices, significant resources - Steep Learning Curve: Complex concepts and UI - Not GitOps-First: Push-based, not GitOps pull model - Maintenance Burden: High operational overhead - Overkill: More than we need for Kubernetes deployments</p> <p>Reason for Rejection: Spinnaker powerful but extremely complex. High resource usage (10+ pods) and maintenance burden unjustified for our Kubernetes-focused needs. Not GitOps-native (push model). ArgoCD provides 80% of benefits with 20% of complexity.

opinionated than Jenkins - Smaller Plugin Ecosystem: Fewer actions than Jenkins plugins - No Shared Libraries: Harder to share pipeline code across repos - Limited RBAC: Access control less granular</p> <p>Reason for Rejection: While excellent for GitHub-centric projects, GitHub Actions creates vendor lock-in. Cost at scale significant (100 builds/day \u00d7 10 min \u00d7 $0.008 = $240/month, $2,880/year just for CI). Self-hosted runners less mature than Jenkins Kubernetes agents.

read-heavy workloads - MariaDB fully open source - Wide adoption - Familiar to many developers</p> <p>Cons: - Weaker JSON Support: JSON type less powerful than PostgreSQL JSONB - Limited Full-Text Search: Not as robust as PostgreSQL - Fewer Advanced Features: Less support for CTEs, window functions - Fragmentation: MySQL (Oracle) vs. MariaDB (community) split - Less Cloud-Native: Kubernetes operators less mature</p> <p>Reason for Rejection: PostgreSQL's superior JSON support, full-text search, and advanced SQL features better fit Fawkes needs.

MySQL excellent database but PostgreSQL better alignment with cloud-native ecosystem.</p>"},{"location":"adr/ADR-006%20postgres/#alternative-2-mongodb","title":"Alternative 2: MongoDB","text":"<p>Pros: - Document-oriented (flexible schema) - Excellent for JSON data - Horizontal scaling built-in - High write throughput - Popular for modern applications</p> <p>Cons: - NoSQL: Not all components support MongoDB - No ACID Across Collections: Weak consistency by default - Limited Joins: Embedding vs. referencing trade-offs - Operational Complexity: Sharding complex to manage - Backstage Not Supported: Backstage requires SQL database - License Concerns: SSPL license controversial</p> <p>Reason for Rejection: MongoDB excellent for document storage but incompatible with key components (Backstage, SonarQube). ACID properties critical for catalog and metrics. SQL relationships important for service dependencies. PostgreSQL JSONB provides flexible schema when needed while maintaining SQL strengths.</p>"},{"location":"adr/ADR-006%20postgres/#alternative-3-sqlite","title":"Alternative 3: SQLite","text":"<p>Pros: - Zero configuration - No separate server process - Very lightweight - Fast for single-user scenarios - Embedded database</p> <p>Cons: - No Concurrency: Limited concurrent writes - No Network Access: File-based only - No Replication: No built-in HA - Not Kubernetes-Native: File-based doesn't fit pods well - Scalability Limits: Not designed for multi-user systems</p> <p>Reason for Rejection: SQLite excellent for local development and embedded use cases but not suitable for multi-user platform services.

hypothesize the following about the demand for a service that provides DORA metrics visualization:</p> <p>Hypothesis Statement:</p> <p>We believe that Improvement-Driven Leaders within software development organizations will find significant value in a service that provides easily accessible, objective visualization of DORA metrics.</p> <p>Because:</p> <ul> <li>DORA metrics (change lead time, deployment frequency, change fail percentage, failed deployment recovery time) are globally recognized and validated indicators of software delivery performance and overall organizational outcomes [6, 7].</li> <li>Improvement-Driven Leaders need objective data to understand the current state of their software delivery process and identify specific areas for improvement [5, 8].</li> <li>There is a common pain point where management doesn't fully understand the software process or the challenges faced by development and operations teams, leading to misaligned expectations and pressure [1-3].</li> <li>Providing end-to-end dashboards for stakeholders to view performance is a key practice for mitigating challenges and enabling data-driven decision-making [8].</li> <li>Metrics are a requirement for excellence and facilitate informed decision-making [8].</li> <li>Organizations often struggle to effectively collect and present these critical metrics from their existing toolchains [8, 14-16].</li> <li>A service focused on delivering these core metrics addresses a fundamental need for visibility and insight necessary for an improvement-driven approach [5, 7].</li> </ul> <p>Therefore:</p> <ul> <li>Providing a clear, centralized view of DORA metrics will solve a key pain point for leaders struggling to measure and understand their team's performance.</li> <li>This service will enable leaders to make better decisions, justify investments in process improvements, and communicate performance effectively across the organization.</li> <li>The demand for such a service is driven by the need to identify and address inefficiencies and bottlenecks in the software delivery lifecycle, ultimately helping organizations get \"better at getting better\" [5].</li> <li>While platforms like Backstage exist, a focused MVP on DORA metrics addresses the specific need for performance visibility directly, potentially with less initial overhead than a full IDP implementation, thus being valuable as a targeted solution for this persona.</li> </ul> <p>Validation Strategy (Implicit/Next Steps):</p> <ul> <li>Engage directly with potential customers (Improvement-Driven Leaders) to confirm these pain points and the perceived value of a DORA metrics dashboard [17].</li> <li>Leverage tools and methods for identifying pain points such as surveys, interviews, analyzing forum discussions (like on Reddit) related to DevOps, performance, and management challenges [17-26].</li> <li>Start with a DORA Quick Check style conversation [Conversation History] to assess current understanding and perceived needs regarding performance metrics.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"design/Jobs%20to%20Be%20Done%20%28JTBD%29%20for%20the%20Improve/","title":"Jobs to
