## 1. Access to Repositories and Tools

- **GitHub:**  
  Ask your team lead or project admin to invite you to the [paruff/fawkes GitHub organization](https://github.com/paruff/fawkes).  
  Once invited, accept the invitation via email or directly on GitHub.

- **Jira or Issue Tracker:**  
  If your team uses Jira or another issue tracker, request access from your project admin.

- Use the provided scripts for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) to install required tools and configure your workspace.
- If you have issues, check the [Troubleshooting](infra/workspace/readme.md#troubleshooting) section or open a GitHub Issue.
