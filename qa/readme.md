# QA Directory

This directory contains all quality assurance resources for the Fawkes Internal Developer Platform.  
It is organized to clearly separate and communicate the different types of testing and analysis performed in this project.

## Test Types

- **Static Analysis:**  
  Automated code quality and security checks using tools like SonarQube, Checkstyle, or SpotBugs.

- **Unit Testing:**  
  Fast, isolated tests for individual components or functions.

- **Integration Testing:**  
  Tests that verify interactions between components or with external systems.

- **Acceptance Testing:**  
  End-to-end tests that validate user workflows and requirements.

- **Performance Testing:**  
  Load and stress tests to ensure the platform meets performance goals.

- **Security Testing:**  
  Automated scans for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations using tools like Trivy, Snyk, or OWASP ZAP.

---

## Running Tests

- Use the scripts in `qa/scripts/` to run all or specific test suites.
- Test reports are collected in `qa/reports/` for review and CI/CD integration.
- The `pom.xml` in this directory manages test dependencies for Java-based tests.

---

## Recommendations

- Keep each test type in its respective directory for clarity and maintainability.
- Document any custom test setups or requirements in a `README.md` within each subdirectory.
- Integrate static analysis and security scanning into your CI/CD pipeline.
- Regularly review and update test dependencies and tools for best coverage and security.
