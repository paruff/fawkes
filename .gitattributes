# Git LFS Configuration for Fawkes Repository
#
# This file configures Git Large File Storage (LFS) to handle large binary files
# efficiently. Files matching these patterns are stored as LFS objects rather than
# in the standard Git repository.
#
# Git LFS is particularly important for the user research repository where we store
# interview recordings, user testing videos, and other large media files.

# Video files - user research recordings, demos, tutorials
