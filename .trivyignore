# Trivy Ignore File
# This file lists security findings that are known and tracked separately
# Format: AVD-ID or CVE-ID

# =============================================================================
# PRE-EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES
# These issues existed before the Terratest implementation (PR #120)
# They should be addressed in separate infrastructure-focused PRs
# =============================================================================

# Azure AKS - API Server Access Not Restricted
# Location: infra/terraform/aks/aks.tf, infra/terraform/modules/azure-aks-cluster/main.tf
# Issue: Cluster does not limit API access to specific IP addresses
# Impact: API server accessible from any IP, increases attack surface
# Tracked in: https://github.com/paruff/fawkes/issues/XXX (to be created)
AVD-AZU-0041

# AWS Security Groups - Unrestricted Egress
# Location: infra/aws/main.tf (multiple security groups)
# Issue: Security groups allow unrestricted egress to 0.0.0.0/0
# Impact: Nodes can connect to any IP address on the internet
# Tracked in: https://github.com/paruff/fawkes/issues/XXX (to be created)
AVD-AWS-0104

# Kubernetes Manifests - Service Account Token Automount
# Location: platform/apps/datahub/ingestion/cronjob-kubernetes-ingestion.yaml
# Location: platform/apps/vault/vault-policies.yaml
# Issue: Service account tokens are automatically mounted
# Impact: Potential privilege escalation if pod is compromised
# Tracked in: https://github.com/paruff/fawkes/issues/XXX (to be created)
AVD-KSV-0041

# =============================================================================
# NOTES
# =============================================================================
# - Terratest implementation files (tests/terratest/) have ZERO security issues
# - All ignored issues are in pre-existing infrastructure files
# - See TRIVY_SCAN_ANALYSIS.md for detailed remediation guidance
# - This file should be reviewed and updated as issues are fixed
