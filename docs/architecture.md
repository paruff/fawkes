# Fawkes Platform Architecture

This document provides an overview of the architecture for the Fawkes Internal Developer Platform (IDP), including its core components, infrastructure layers, and integration points.

---

## Overview

Fawkes is designed as a modular, cloud-native platform to accelerate infrastructure provisioning and developer productivity. It leverages Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Kubernetes, and a suite of open source tools to provide a secure, scalable, and extensible developer experience.

---

## Design Principles

Fawkes is heavily influenced by the research and best practices from the [Accelerate](https://itrevolution.com/accelerate-book/) book, the [DORA](https://dora.dev/) (DevOps Research and Assessment) reports, and the State of DevOps reports.  
The platform is built to help teams measure and improve the **Four Key DORA Metrics**:

- **Deployment Frequency**
- **Lead Time for Changes**
- **Change Failure Rate**
- **Mean Time to Restore (MTTR)**

Fawkes also aims to implement the [24 DORA capabilities](https://dora.dev/), with a special focus on the 8 capabilities related to Continuous Delivery.  
These principles guide the platform's architecture, automation, and extensibility, ensuring teams can continuously improve their software delivery performance.

## Core Components

### 1. **Infrastructure Layer (`infra/`)**
- **Terraform Modules:** Used for provisioning cloud resources (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.).
- **Kubernetes Manifests & Helm Charts:** For deploying and managing workloads.
- **Bootstrap & Helper Scripts:** Automate setup, configuration, and deployment.

### 2. **Platform Layer (`platform/`)**
- **CI/CD Services:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or other CI/CD tools.
- **Quality & Security:** SonarQube, static analysis, and vulnerability scanning.
- **Developer Tools:** Kubernetes Dashboard, monitoring, and logging stacks.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** (Optional) Keycloak or other SSO/IdP solutions.

### 3. **Workspace Automation (`workspace/`)**
- Scripts and configs for setting up local developer environments.
- Editor/IDE settings, dotfiles, and onboarding automation.

### 4. **Quality Assurance (`qa/`)**
- Automated test suites, integration tests, and quality gates.

## Infrastructure Flow

1. **Provisioning:**  
   - Use Terraform scripts in `infra/` to provision cloud resources (VPC, EKS/AKS/GKE clusters, storage, etc.).
   - Kubernetes clusters are bootstrapped with required namespaces and RBAC.

2. **Platform Deployment:**  
   - Deploy core platform services (Jenkins, SonarQube, etc.) using Helm or custom scripts.
   - Configure ingress, secrets, and monitoring.

3. **Developer Onboarding:**  
   - Developers use scripts in `workspace/` to set up their local environments and connect to the platform.

4. **CI/CD & Workflows:**  
   - Source code is built, tested, and deployed using the platformâ€™s CI/CD pipelines.
   - Artifacts and logs are stored and accessible via platform services.

---

## Extensibility

- **Multi-Cloud Support:** Modular Terraform and Kubernetes manifests support AWS, Azure, and GCP.
- **Pluggable Services:** Easily add or replace CI/CD, monitoring, or authentication tools.
- **Custom Workflows:** Extend with custom scripts, APIs, or plugins.

---

## Security & Best Practices

- Secrets are managed outside of version control and injected at deploy time.
- Follows cloud and Kubernetes security best practices (RBAC, network policies, etc.).
- Automated vulnerability scanning and compliance checks.
