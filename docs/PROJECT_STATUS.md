## 🔑 Key Decisions Made

| Date | Decision | Documented In | Rationale |
|------|----------|---------------|-----------|
| Oct 7 | Kubernetes for orchestration | ADR-001 | Industry standard, CNCF ecosystem, multi-cloud |
| Oct 7 | Mattermost for collaboration | ADR-007 | Open source, self-hosted, Focalboard integration |
| Oct 7 | Belt-based dojo system | Dojo Architecture | Clear progression, gamification, skill validation |
| Oct 7 | MIT License | Project Charter | Maximum openness, minimal restrictions |

### Pending Decisions
- [ ] Slack vs. Discord for initial community (leaning toward Mattermost only)
- [ ] Backstage theme and branding
- [ ] Dogfooding environment cloud provider (waiting on AWS credits)
- [ ] First external beta testers (target: 3-5 organizations)

---

## 🚫 Blockers & Issues

### Active Blockers
1. **AWS Credits Approval** (Blocker ID: B-001)
   - **Impact**: Cannot provision dogfooding environment
   - **Workaround**: Use personal AWS account with minimal resources
   - **Status**: Application submitted Oct 6, waiting for approval
   - **ETA**: 7-14 days
   - **Owner**: Project Lead

### Resolved Blockers
- None yet

### Known Issues
1. **Issue: No CI/CD for platform repo yet**
   - **Impact**: No automated validation of Terraform, no branch protection
   - **Priority**: P1
   - **Planned Resolution**: Sprint 01, Week 1
   
2. **Issue: Dojo content creation resource intensive**
   - **Impact**: May take longer than estimated to create 20 modules
   - **Priority**: P2
   - **Mitigation**: Start with White Belt only for MVP, crowdsource community content
