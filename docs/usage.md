## Accessing Platform Services

After deployment, you can access services such as Jenkins, SonarQube, and the Kubernetes Dashboard:

- **Jenkins:**  
  Access Jenkins via the provided URL (e.g., `http://<jenkins-lb>:8080`).  
  Retrieve the admin password using:
  ```sh
  kubectl get secret --namespace <namespace> jenkins -o jsonpath="{.data.jenkins-admin-password}" | base64 --decode
  ```

- **SonarQube:**  
  Access SonarQube via the provided URL (e.g., `http://<sonarqube-lb>:9000`).  
  Default credentials: `admin` / `admin`.

- **Kubernetes Dashboard:**  
  Access the dashboard via the provided URL. Retrieve the admin token using:
  ```sh
  kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard describe secret $(kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard get secret | grep admin-user | awk '{print $1}')
  ```

---

## Managing Infrastructure

- **Provisioning Infrastructure:**  
  Use the provided scripts in the `infra/` directory to provision or update infrastructure:
  ```sh
  cd infra
  ./infra-boot.sh -p aws -e dev
  ```

- **Destroying Infrastructure:**  
  To tear down infrastructure:
  ```sh
  cd infra
  ./infra-boot.sh -p aws -e dev --destroy
  ```

- **Using Terraform Directly:**  
  Advanced users can manage infrastructure directly with Terraform:
  ```sh
  cd infra/platform/aws
  terraform init
  terraform plan
  terraform apply
  ```

---

## Deploying Platform Services

- **Jenkins Deployment:**  
  Deploy Jenkins using the provided script:
  ```sh
  cd platform/jenkins
  ./jenkins-delta.sh -i
  ```

- **Other Services:**  
  Each service directory contains deployment scripts or Helm charts. Refer to the respective README files for details.

---

## Viewing Outputs and Endpoints

After deployment, service URLs and credentials are displayed in the terminal.  
You can also retrieve them using:

- **Terraform Outputs:**
  ```sh
  terraform output
  ```

- **Deployment Script Outputs:**
  ```sh
  ./jenkins-delta.sh -s
  ```

---

## CI/CD and Developer Workflows

- **Pipelines:**  
  Jenkins is pre-configured for CI/CD. Add your repositories and configure pipelines as needed.

- **Workspace Automation:**  
  Use scripts in the `workspace/` directory to set up local development environments.

## Measuring and Improving DORA Metrics

Fawkes is designed to help teams measure and improve the [Four Key DORA Metrics](https://www.devops-research.com/research.html):

- **Deployment Frequency**
- **Lead Time for Changes**
- **Change Failure Rate**
- **Mean Time to Restore (MTTR)**

### How Fawkes Helps:

- **Automated CI/CD Pipelines:** Jenkins and other integrated tools provide metrics on deployment frequency and lead time.
- **Quality Gates:** SonarQube and automated tests help reduce change failure rate.
- **Monitoring & Alerts:** Integrated monitoring and logging help track and reduce MTTR.
- **Reporting:** Extract and visualize DORA metrics from pipeline logs, test reports, and monitoring dashboards.

> See the [architecture](architecture.md) and [development guide](development.md) for more on how Fawkes supports DORA capabilities and continuous improvement.

---

## Configuration Management

- All configuration files are located in the `infra/` and `platform/` directories.
- Secrets should **not** be committed to version control. Use templates and inject secrets at deploy time.
- See [configuration.md](configuration.md) for details on environment variables and secret management.

---

## Troubleshooting

- See [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md) for common issues and solutions.
- For further help, open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/paruff/fawkes/issues).
