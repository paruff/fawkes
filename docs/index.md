Welcome to the Fawkes project! Fawkes is an open-source platform designed to help teams achieve **elite performance** in software delivery by implementing all **24 DORA capabilities** through integrated tooling and practices. Based on research from "Accelerate" and the DORA State of DevOps reports, organizations that excel in these capabilities are **twice as likely to exceed their organizational performance goals**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Elite Performance Targets

| Metric | Elite Performance | Industry Average |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| ![](assets/images/icons/deployment-frequency.png){ width="24" } **Deployment Frequency** | Multiple deploys per day | Between once per week and once per month |
| ![](assets/images/icons/lead-time.png){ width="24" } **Lead Time** | Less than one hour | Between one week and one month |
| ![](assets/images/icons/change-failure.png){ width="24" } **Change Failure Rate** | 0-15% | 31-45% |
| ![](assets/images/icons/mttr.png){ width="24" } **MTTR** | Less than one hour | Less than one day |
