Welcome to the Fawkes project! Fawkes is an open-source platform designed to help teams improve their **software delivery performance** by implementing all **24 DORA capabilities** through integrated tooling and practices.

## ðŸš€ Key Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ![](assets/images/icons/deployment-frequency.png){ width="24" } **Deployment Frequency** | How often an organization successfully releases to production |
| ![](assets/images/icons/lead-time.png){ width="24" } **Lead Time** | The time it takes to go from code committed to code successfully running in production |
| ![](assets/images/icons/change-failure.png){ width="24" } **Change Failure Rate** | The percentage of changes that result in a failure in production |
| ![](assets/images/icons/mttr.png){ width="24" } **MTTR** | Mean Time to Restore - The time it takes to recover from a failure in production |
