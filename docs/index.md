Welcome to the Fawkes project!  
Fawkes is an open-source platform designed to help teams improve their **software delivery performance** by focusing on **metrics first** and supporting the capabilities needed to enhance those metrics.

## üöÄ Metrics-First Approach

![DORA Metrics](assets/images/dora-metrics.png)

Fawkes is built to help teams measure and improve the **Four Key Metrics** identified in the DORA reports:

1. ![Deployment Frequency](assets/images/icons/deployment-frequency.png) **Deployment Frequency**: How often an organization successfully releases to production.
2. ![Lead Time](assets/images/icons/lead-time.png) **Lead Time for Changes**: The time it takes to go from code committed to code successfully running in production.
3. ![Change Failure Rate](assets/images/icons/change-failure.png) **Change Failure Rate**: The percentage of changes that result in a failure in production.
4. ![MTTR](assets/images/icons/mttr.png) **Mean Time to Restore (MTTR)**: The time it takes to recover from a failure in production.

By focusing on these metrics, Fawkes enables teams to deliver software faster, more reliably, and with reduced risk.

## üåü Capabilities for Continuous Delivery

![DORA Capabilities](assets/images/dora-capabilities.png)

Fawkes supports the **eight capabilities** from the **24 identified in Accelerate and the DORA reports** that focus on **continuous delivery**:

1. ![CD](assets/images/icons/continuous-delivery.png) **Continuous Delivery** ‚Äì Ensuring software is always in a deployable state and can be released on demand.
2. ![Automation](assets/images/icons/automation.png) **Deployment Automation** ‚Äì Automating the deployment process to reduce manual intervention and improve reliability.
3. ![CI](assets/images/icons/continuous-integration.png) **Continuous Integration** ‚Äì Frequently merging code changes and running automated tests to catch issues early.
4. ![Database](assets/images/icons/database.png) **Database Change Management** ‚Äì Managing database changes effectively to prevent bottlenecks and failures.
5. ![Infrastructure](assets/images/icons/infrastructure.png) **Flexible Infrastructure** ‚Äì Using cloud and infrastructure-as-code practices to improve agility and scalability.
6. ![Architecture](assets/images/icons/architecture.png) **Loosely Coupled Architecture** ‚Äì Designing systems that allow teams to work independently without dependencies slowing them down.
7. ![Approval](assets/images/icons/approval.png) **Streamlining Change Approval** ‚Äì Replacing heavyweight approval processes with peer reviews to speed up releases.
8. ![Monitoring](assets/images/icons/monitoring.png) **Monitoring and Observability** ‚Äì Implementing logging, monitoring, and alerting to ensure system health and quick issue resolution.

These capabilities are embedded into the Fawkes platform to help teams achieve elite performance in software delivery. üöÄ
