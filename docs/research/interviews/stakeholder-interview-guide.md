## Interview Protocol

### Introduction (5 minutes)

"Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. I'm [Your Name] from the Product Team, and I'm conducting research to understand how the platform supports business goals and how we can better serve stakeholders like yourself.

**Purpose**: We want to learn about your strategic priorities, how you measure success, and what visibility or capabilities would help you make better decisions. This isn't a performance evaluation—we're here to learn from your perspective.

**Confidentiality**: Your responses will be anonymized. We won't share anything that identifies you personally. The insights will inform platform strategy and investment decisions.

**Recording**: [If applicable] With your permission, I'd like to record this session for note-taking purposes only. The recording will be deleted after we transcribe it. Are you comfortable with that?

**Format**: I'll ask you questions about your business goals, challenges, and how the platform impacts your work. Feel free to share examples, data, or specific situations you've encountered. We have about 45-60 minutes.

**Questions?**: Do you have any questions before we start?"

## Tips for Effective Interviewing

### Do's ✅

- **Speak their language**: Use business terms (ROI, time-to-market, KPIs) not just technical jargon
- **Respect their time**: Be punctual and efficient—executives are busy
- **Ask for specifics**: "Can you give me a recent example?" grounds abstract concepts
- **Connect to business impact**: Always tie platform capabilities to business outcomes
- **Explore metrics**: Understand what they measure and why
- **Understand context**: Learn about market pressures, competitive landscape
- **Be strategic**: Focus on high-level goals, not implementation details

### Don'ts ❌

- **Don't get too technical**: Unless they're technical, avoid deep technical discussions
- **Don't defend the platform**: Stay curious and neutral
- **Don't dismiss "soft" concerns**: Culture, morale, and team health matter
- **Don't ignore politics**: Organizational dynamics are real and important
- **Don't skip financial impact**: Understand costs, savings, revenue impact
- **Don't forget the human element**: Stakeholders care about their teams
- **Don't assume they know platform details**: Explain context when needed

### Effective Follow-up Questions

- "What's the business impact of that?"
- "How do you measure that today?"
- "What would that enable you to do?"
- "How does this compare to competitors?"
- "What's the cost of not solving this?"
- "What would the ROI be?"
- "Who else is affected by this?"
- "What would success look like in concrete terms?"
