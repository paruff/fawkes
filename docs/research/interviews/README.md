# Interview Notes

This directory contains notes and findings from user interviews, usability testing sessions, and feedback conversations.

## About Interviews

User interviews help us understand:
- Current workflows and pain points
- Unmet needs and frustrations
- User goals and motivations
- Opportunities for improvement

## Creating Interview Notes

1. **Use the interview guide template**:
   ```bash
   # Reference the template when preparing
   cat ../templates/interview-guide.md
   ```

2. **Follow naming convention**: `YYYY-MM-DD-{role}-{topic}.md`
   - Example: `2025-12-23-platform-engineer-deployment-experience.md`

3. **Include these sections**:
   - Participant background (role, experience, anonymized)
   - Interview questions and responses
   - Key quotes (verbatim from user)
   - Observations and insights
   - Follow-up actions

4. **Anonymize data**:
   - Remove personally identifiable information (PII)
   - Use role descriptions instead of names
   - Obtain consent before recording

## Interview Types

### Discovery Interviews
- **Purpose**: Explore problems, needs, and workflows
- **When**: Early research, problem validation
- **Duration**: 45-60 minutes
- **Output**: Pain points, opportunity areas

### Usability Testing
- **Purpose**: Test feature usability and workflows
- **When**: Before and after feature launch
- **Duration**: 30-45 minutes
- **Output**: Usability issues, success metrics

### Feedback Interviews
- **Purpose**: Gather feedback on existing features
- **When**: Post-launch, continuous improvement
- **Duration**: 30 minutes
- **Output**: Satisfaction scores, improvement ideas

### Onboarding Interviews
- **Purpose**: Understand new user experience
- **When**: Within 2 weeks of user onboarding
- **Duration**: 30-45 minutes
- **Output**: Onboarding friction, knowledge gaps

## Best Practices

✅ **Do:**
- Transcribe notes within 24 hours while memory is fresh
- Include direct quotes with context
- Capture both what users say and what they do
- Note emotional reactions and body language
- Link to related personas and journey maps
- Store recordings securely (not in this repo)

❌ **Don't:**
- Include names or PII in notes
- Lead participants with biased questions
- Skip consent for recording
- Cherry-pick data to support preconceptions
- Wait too long to document findings

## Privacy Guidelines

- **Consent**: Always obtain explicit consent before recording
- **Anonymization**: Remove all PII from notes
- **Storage**: Keep raw recordings in secure storage (not Git)
- **Retention**: Delete recordings after 1 year or per policy
- **Access**: Limit access to anonymized notes only
