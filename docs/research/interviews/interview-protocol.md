## During the Interview

### Opening the Interview (5 minutes)

**Build Rapport**:

- Start with casual conversation (weather, weekend, recent events)
- Thank them for their time
- Express genuine interest in learning from them
- Use their preferred name

**Set Context**:

```
"Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. I'm [Your Name]
from the Product Team, and I'm conducting research to understand
[research objective].

We're here to learn from your experience and perspective. This isn't a
test—there are no wrong answers. We want to understand your workflows,
challenges, and needs so we can improve the platform.

Your responses will be anonymized, and we won't share anything that
identifies you personally. The insights will inform platform improvements.

[If recording:] With your permission, I'd like to record this session
for note-taking purposes only. The recording will be deleted after we
transcribe it. Are you comfortable with that?

We have about [45-60 minutes]. I'll ask questions and would love to hear
examples, see demonstrations, or anything else you'd like to share.
Feel free to be candid—we value honest feedback.

Do you have any questions before we start?"
```

**Obtain Consent**:

- Get explicit verbal (or written) consent to participate
- If recording, get explicit consent to record
- Confirm they understand confidentiality measures
- Give them opportunity to ask questions

### Conducting the Interview (35-45 minutes)

**Follow the Interview Guide**:

- Use prepared questions as a framework, not a rigid script
- Be comfortable deviating to explore interesting topics
- Return to key questions to ensure coverage
- Adapt language and detail level to participant

**Active Listening Techniques**:

- **Maintain eye contact** (if video/in-person)
- **Use non-verbal encouragement**: nodding, "mm-hmm", leaning in
- **Don't interrupt**: Let them finish thoughts completely
- **Embrace silence**: Pause after answers to allow elaboration
- **Paraphrase**: "So what I'm hearing is..." to confirm understanding
- **Reflect emotion**: "That sounds frustrating" to show empathy

**Effective Probing**:

- **Ask for specifics**: "Can you give me a recent example?"
- **Use the 5 Whys**: Dig deeper with "Why?" or "What led to that?"
- **Request demonstrations**: "Can you show me how you do that?"
- **Explore feelings**: "How did that make you feel?"
- **Investigate workarounds**: "What do you do instead?"
- **Understand impact**: "How does this affect your work?"

**Time Management**:

- Track time discreetly (clock visible, not timer)
- Allocate time per section from interview guide
- Be flexible to spend more time on rich topics
- Give 10-minute warning before end
- Ensure you cover critical questions even if you skip others

**Note-Taking During Interview**:

- Capture direct quotes (mark with quotation marks)
- Note emotional reactions or body language
- Star or highlight key insights
- Use shorthand for efficiency
- Don't let note-taking distract from conversation
- It's okay to say "Hold on, let me write that down" for important points

### Closing the Interview (5 minutes)

**Wrap-Up Questions**:

- "Is there anything we haven't covered that you think is important?"
- "What's one thing you wish we had asked about?"
- "Can we reach out if we have follow-up questions?"

**Thank Participant**:

- Express genuine gratitude for their time and insights
- Explain what will happen next with their feedback
- Mention how their input will be used (generally)
- If appropriate, mention when they might see changes

**Next Steps**:

- Confirm contact information for follow-up
- Ask about willingness to participate in future research
- Distribute any incentives or thank-you gifts
- Send calendar invite for any follow-up sessions

**Post-Interview Debrief** (if multiple researchers):

- Spend 5-10 minutes immediately after to discuss
- Share initial impressions and surprises
- Identify key quotes and insights
- Note any urgent issues or action items

## Interview Best Practices

### Building Trust and Rapport

✅ **Do**:

- Be warm, authentic, and curious
- Show empathy for their challenges
- Use their terminology and language
- Validate their feelings and experiences
- Be transparent about research purpose
- Keep your commitments (punctuality, follow-up)

❌ **Don't**:

- Be overly formal or scripted
- Treat them as data sources rather than people
- Dismiss their concerns or frustrations
- Rush through personal connection
- Make promises you can't keep

### Asking Effective Questions

✅ **Do**:

- Ask open-ended questions ("How...?", "What...?", "Tell me about...")
- Request specific examples ("Can you walk me through the last time...?")
- Explore context and motivation ("Why is that important to you?")
- Follow interesting threads even if off-script
- Use silence to encourage elaboration

❌ **Don't**:

- Ask leading questions ("Don't you think...?", "Wouldn't it be better if...?")
- Ask yes/no questions when you want detail
- Ask multiple questions at once (compound questions)
- Use technical jargon unless participant uses it first
- Assume you understand without clarifying

### Staying Neutral and Objective

✅ **Do**:

- Accept all feedback without judgment
- Explore negative feedback as deeply as positive
- Stay curious about perspectives different from yours
- Acknowledge their experience without agreeing or disagreeing
- Take notes on what they say, not what you think

❌ **Don't**:

- Defend platform decisions or features
- Explain why things are the way they are
- Correct their "misunderstandings"
- Show disappointment in their answers
- Guide them toward "correct" responses

### Managing Difficult Situations

**Participant is off-topic**:

- Listen respectfully for a moment
- Acknowledge their point
- Redirect: "That's interesting. I'd like to get back to..."
- Be gentle but firm with time boundaries

**Participant is negative about everything**:

- Explore the root cause of frustration
- Ask for specific examples
- Look for what would improve their experience
- Thank them for candid feedback

**Participant is giving one-word answers**:

- Ask follow-up questions
- Request examples or demonstrations
- Share what you're trying to understand
- Acknowledge this might not be the right time; offer to reschedule

**Participant wants to solve problems in the interview**:

- Acknowledge the desire to improve things
- Explain your role is to understand, not implement
- Offer to connect them with appropriate team
- Capture their ideas as feature requests

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Leading the Witness

**Pitfall**: Asking questions that suggest the answer you want

- ❌ "Don't you find deployments frustrating?"
- ✅ "How do you feel about deployments?"

### 2. Solving Instead of Learning

**Pitfall**: Jumping to solutions or explaining features

- ❌ "Oh, we have a feature for that! Let me show you..."
- ✅ "Interesting. Tell me more about what you're trying to accomplish."

### 3. Confirmation Bias

**Pitfall**: Only hearing evidence that supports your beliefs

- ❌ Ignoring data that contradicts your hypothesis
- ✅ Actively seeking disconfirming evidence

### 4. Cherry-Picking Data

**Pitfall**: Only sharing feedback that supports your position

- ❌ Highlighting positive feedback and burying negative
- ✅ Sharing all findings, positive and negative

### 5. Asking Hypothetical Questions

**Pitfall**: "Would you use a feature that...?"

- ❌ People are bad at predicting their future behavior
- ✅ Ask about actual past behavior and current needs

### 6. Ignoring Workarounds

**Pitfall**: Missing the creative solutions users have built

- ❌ Dismissing workarounds as "wrong"
- ✅ Exploring workarounds reveals unmet needs

### 7. Over-Relying on Self-Reported Behavior

**Pitfall**: Trusting what people say they do, not what they actually do

- ❌ "How often do you deploy?"
- ✅ "Tell me about the last time you deployed."
