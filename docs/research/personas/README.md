# User Personas

This directory contains user personas for the Fawkes platform. Each persona represents a key user segment based on research data from interviews, surveys, and analytics.

## About Personas

Personas are fictional but data-driven representations of our users. They help us:
- Build empathy with our users
- Make user-centered design decisions
- Prioritize features based on user needs
- Communicate insights across teams

## Creating a New Persona

1. **Copy the template**:
   ```bash
   cp ../templates/persona.md your-persona-name.md
   ```

2. **Base it on research**: Conduct at least 5-7 interviews with similar users before creating a persona

3. **Include key elements**:
   - Role and responsibilities
   - Goals and motivations
   - Pain points and frustrations
   - Tools and workflows
   - Technical skill level
   - Direct quotes from research

4. **Use clear naming**: `{role}-{descriptor}.md`
   - Example: `platform-engineer-senior.md`

## Current Personas

<!-- List your personas here as you create them -->
<!-- Example:
- [Senior Platform Engineer](platform-engineer-senior.md) - Infrastructure guardian focused on reliability
- [Application Developer](app-developer-mid.md) - Feature shipper focused on velocity
-->

## Persona Lifecycle

- **Create**: After identifying a distinct user segment from research
- **Review**: Quarterly or when significant new insights emerge
- **Update**: Add new insights, quotes, and behaviors
- **Archive**: Move to `archived/` folder if no longer relevant

## Best Practices

✅ **Do:**
- Base personas on real user data
- Include direct quotes from interviews
- Focus on behaviors and goals, not just demographics
- Keep personas current (review quarterly)
- Cross-reference related journey maps

❌ **Don't:**
- Create personas based on assumptions
- Make personas too generic
- Create too many personas (3-5 is ideal)
- Let personas become outdated
- Include personally identifiable information
