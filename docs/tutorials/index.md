# Tutorials

Tutorials are **learning-oriented** experiences. They guide you through a series of steps to complete a project or learn a new concept. Unlike how-to guides, tutorials focus on learning, not accomplishing a specific task.

## What You'll Find Here

Tutorials in Fawkes are designed to:

- Take you by the hand through a complete learning experience
- Help you build understanding through practical exercises
- Introduce concepts in a logical, incremental order
- Provide a safe environment to learn and experiment
