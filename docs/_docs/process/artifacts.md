# Artifacts

These are the tools we scrum practitioners use to make our process visible.
The Product Backlog

The product backlog is the cumulative list of desired deliverables for the product. This includes features, bug fixes, documentation changes, and anything else that might be meaningful and valuable to produce. Generically, they are all referred to as “backlog items.” While backlog item is technically correct, many scrum teams prefer the term “user story,” as it reminds us that we build products to satisfy our users' needs.

The list of user stories is ordered such that the most important story, the one that the team should do next, is at the top of the list. Right below it is the story that the team should do second, and so on. Since stories near the top of the product backlog will be worked on soon, they should be small and well understood by the whole team. Stories further down in the list can be larger and less well understood, as it will be some time before the team works on them.

Each item, or story, in the product backlog should include the following information:

    Which users the story will benefit (who it is for)
    A brief description of the desired functionality (what needs to be built)
    The reason that this story is valuable (why we should do it)
    An estimate as to how much work the story requires to implement
    Acceptance criteria that will help us know when it has been implemented correctly

## The Sprint Backlog

The sprint backlog is the team’s to do list for the sprint. Unlike the product backlog, it has a finite life-span: the length of the current sprint. It includes: all the stories that the team has committed to delivering this sprint and their associated tasks. Stories are deliverables, and can be thought of as units of value. Tasks are things that must be done, in order to deliver the stories, and so tasks can be thought of as units of work. A story is something a team delivers; a task is a bit of work that a person does. Each story will normally require many tasks.

## Burn Charts

A burn chart shows us the relationship between time and scope. Time is on the horizontal X-axis and scope is on the vertical Y-axis. A burn up chart shows us how much scope the team has got done over a period of time. Each time something new is completed the line on the chart moves up. A burn down chart shows us what is left to do. In general, we expect the work remaining to go down over time as the team gets things done. Sometimes the work remaining changes suddenly, when scope is added or removed. These events appear as vertical lines on the burn down chart: a vertical line up when we add new work, or down when we remove some work from the plan.

## Task Board

When the team's tasks are visible to everyone from across the room, you never have to worry that some important piece of work will be forgotten.
The simplest task board consists of three columns: to do, doing and done. Tasks move across the board, providing visibility regarding which tasks are done, which are in progress, and which are yet to be started. This visibility helps the team inspect their current situation and adapt as needed. The board also helps stakeholders see the progress that the team is making.

## Definition of Done

Done is a wonderful word; when the team gets a user story done it's time to celebrate! But sometimes there is confusion about exactly what that word "done" means. A programmer might call something done when the code has been written. The tester might think that done means that all of the tests have passed. The operations person might think that done means it's been loaded onto the production servers. A business person may think that done means we can now sell it to customers, and it's ready for them to use. This confusion about what "done" means can cause plenty of confusion and trouble, when the salesperson asks why the team is still working on the same story that the programmer said was done two weeks ago!

In order to avoid confusion, good scrum teams create their own definition of the word "done" when it is applied to a user story. They decide together what things will be complete before the team declares a story to be done. The team's definition may include things like: code written, code reviewed, unit tests passing, regression tests passing, documentation written, product owner sign-off, and so on. This list of things that the team agrees to always do before declaring a story done becomes the teams "definition of done." The team will likely print out their definition of done as a checklist, and post it next to their task board. When the team thinks a story is done, they all gather around and review each item, to confirm that it has been completed. Only then will the team declare the story as done.
