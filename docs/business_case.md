## Executive Summary

**Fawkes** is an open-source Internal Delivery Platform (IDP) that transforms how organizations build and operate software delivery infrastructure. By combining best-in-class tooling (Backstage, Jenkins, ArgoCD, Kubernetes) with an integrated learning system (Fawkes Dojo), we're solving two critical problems simultaneously:

1. **Platform Engineering Skills Gap**: There are 300K+ platform engineering job openings but few trained practitioners
2. **Platform Adoption Barrier**: Organizations struggle to implement IDPs due to complexity and lack of expertise

**Our Solution**: An AWS-native platform that teams can deploy in hours (not months) + a comprehensive learning system that trains the engineers who will operate it.

**Traction to Date**:
- ‚úÖ Complete platform architecture with 8 documented ADRs
- ‚úÖ 50+ pages of technical documentation
- ‚úÖ 5-belt Dojo curriculum (20 modules) designed and documented
- ‚úÖ Open-source MIT license with active GitHub repository
- ‚úÖ Partnership discussions with Platform Engineering University
- ‚úÖ Growing community interest (early stage)

**AWS Activate Request**: $25,000 in credits to:
- Deploy production reference implementation on AWS
- Launch Fawkes Dojo learning platform
- Support 200+ concurrent learners
- Enable 20+ enterprise pilots

**12-Month Goal**: 500 GitHub stars, 200 certified learners, 20 enterprise adoptions, $10K MRR from managed services

## Problem Statement

### The Platform Engineering Crisis

Organizations are hemorrhaging productivity and talent due to infrastructure complexity:

**The Skills Gap**:
- 300,000+ platform engineering jobs unfilled globally (LinkedIn, 2024)
- Average time to hire a platform engineer: 4-6 months
- 73% of engineering leaders cite "platform skills" as top constraint (Gartner, 2024)
- Zero comprehensive training programs exist for platform engineering

**The Adoption Challenge**:
- Average time to deploy an IDP: 6-12 months
- 68% of platform initiatives fail due to complexity (McKinsey, 2023)
- Organizations spend $500K-$2M+ building custom platforms
- Most platforms abandoned after 18 months (lack of adoption)

**The Business Impact**:

According to DORA research (2023):
- Low performers deploy **417x less frequently** than elite performers
- Lead time for changes: **6,570x longer** for low performers
- Organizations lose $1-2M annually in developer productivity
- 35% annual developer turnover due to poor tooling/processes

**Real-World Example**:

A typical 200-person engineering organization:
- **100 developers** spending 70% of time on non-value-added activities
- **Lost productivity**: 70 FTE √ó $150K loaded cost = **$10.5M/year**
- **Opportunity cost**: Features not built, markets not entered
- **Talent drain**: Top performers leave for companies with better platforms

### Why Current Solutions Fail

**Commercial Platforms** (Humanitec, Kratix, etc.):
- ‚ùå Expensive ($50K-$200K/year per team)
- ‚ùå Vendor lock-in and proprietary APIs
- ‚ùå Limited customization for specific needs
- ‚ùå No learning/training included

**DIY Approaches**:
- ‚ùå Take 12-18 months to build
- ‚ùå Require 3-5 FTE platform engineers
- ‚ùå Often abandoned due to complexity
- ‚ùå No standardization across industry

**Training Programs**:
- ‚ùå Fragmented (blog posts, scattered courses)
- ‚ùå Theory-only (no hands-on practice)
- ‚ùå Expensive ($3K-$10K per person)
- ‚ùå Not connected to real platform implementation

### The Market Opportunity

**Platform Engineering Market Size**:
- Current: $4.2B (2024)
- Projected: $12.8B by 2028 (35% CAGR)
- Source: Gartner Platform Engineering Market Analysis

**Target Addressable Market**:
- **Primary**: 50,000 mid-size companies (100-5,000 employees) undergoing digital transformation
- **Secondary**: 100,000 startups scaling engineering teams (20-100 engineers)
- **Tertiary**: 5,000 enterprises seeking inner-source platform solutions

**Revenue Opportunity**:
- **Managed Service**: $500-$2,000/month per organization
- **Enterprise Support**: $50K-$200K/year contracts
- **Training/Certification**: $500-$1,000 per learner
- **Consulting**: $200-$300/hour implementation services

## Appendix B: FAQ for AWS Activate Reviewers

**Q: Is Fawkes a company or an open-source project?**  
A: Fawkes is currently an open-source project (MIT license) with a clear path to becoming a sustainable business through managed services, training, and enterprise support. We're at the pre-seed/bootstrapped stage.

**Q: Why should AWS give credits to an open-source project?**  
A: Because every Fawkes deployment runs on AWS and drives AWS consumption. Our projected impact: 50+ organizations on AWS, $150K+/month AWS spend, 200+ engineers trained on AWS services. The $25K credit investment could drive $500K-1M+ in AWS revenue over 12 months.

**Q: What happens if you run out of credits before becoming profitable?**  
A: We have a phased approach that validates value at each stage. If credits run out, we have contingency plans: migrate to lower-cost regions, apply for additional AWS programs, or customer deployments cover their own infrastructure. However, our financial projections show break-even by month 10-11.

**Q: How is Fawkes different from Backstage?**  
A: Backstage is a developer portal (service catalog, docs). Fawkes is a complete platform that includes Backstage PLUS Jenkins, ArgoCD, Harbor, monitoring, GitOps workflows, automated DORA metrics, and most importantly, a comprehensive training system (Dojo). Backstage is one component of Fawkes.

**Q: Why not just use AWS Proton?**  
A: AWS Proton is excellent but different use case. Proton is AWS-only and template-based. Fawkes is a complete IDP with broader scope (CI/CD, GitOps, training, community) and can deploy to any cloud. They solve different problems. We could integrate with Proton as one deployment option.

**Q: What's your long-term AWS commitment?**  
A: AWS is our primary cloud partner. While we'll add multi-cloud support (Year 2+) for customer demand, AWS will remain our reference implementation, documentation focus, and strategic partnership priority. Our success directly drives AWS consumption.

**Q: How do you plan to make money from open source?**  
A: Three revenue streams: (1) Managed service (hosted Fawkes), (2) Enterprise support contracts, (3) Training and certification. The open-source platform is forever free; we charge for convenience, support, and education. This model has proven successful for Red Hat, Databricks, HashiCorp, etc.

**Q: What if a competitor copies your work (it's open source)?**  
A: That's the point of open source! But our competitive moat is: (1) Community and ecosystem (hard to replicate), (2) Dojo training system (unique differentiator), (3) AWS partnership and co-marketing, (4) First-mover advantage and brand recognition. The code is open, but the community and education ecosystem are our true assets.

**Q: How can you compete with funded startups?**  
A: By staying lean and focused. Our LTV:CAC ratio (13:1) means we can scale profitably without venture funding. AWS Activate credits remove our biggest constraint (infrastructure costs). We're competing on value (free open source + training), not marketing budget.

**Q: What are the biggest risks?**  
A: (1) Low adoption of open source, (2) Difficulty monetizing free users, (3) Competition from funded startups. Mitigations: (1) Heavy investment in docs and community, (2) Clear upgrade path (free ‚Üí paid), (3) Our unique training moat. See full Risk Analysis section for details.
