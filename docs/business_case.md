# Fawkes: Business Case & Value Proposition

## Problem Statement
Organizations waste 70-80% of developer time on infrastructure complexity rather than delivering customer value. According to DORA research, low performers deploy 417x less frequently than elite performers.

## Business Model
1. **Open Source Core** (Current): Community-driven development
2. **Managed Service** (Roadmap): Hosted Fawkes platform (SaaS)
3. **Enterprise Support** (Roadmap): Training, consulting, custom development
4. **Platform Engineering University** (Partnership): Certification and training revenue
