## Cost Optimization Strategy

### Immediate Optimizations (Months 1-6)

**Development Environment**:
- Use Spot Instances for worker nodes: **30% savings** = $27.33/month
- Schedule shutdown during non-business hours (nights/weekends): **60% uptime** = $54.66/month saved
- **Combined Savings**: $82/month or $492 over 6 months

**Staging Environment**:
- Use Spot Instances where possible: **25% savings** = $60.74/month
- Schedule shutdown outside testing windows: **40% savings** = $140.79/month
- **Combined Savings**: $201.53/month or $1,209 over 6 months

**Total Phase 1-2 Savings**: $1,701 over 6 months

### Long-Term Optimizations (Months 7-12)

**Reserved Instances** (1-year commitment after validation):
- EKS Worker Nodes: **40% savings** = $291.53/month
- RDS Instances: **35% savings** = $133.84/month
- **Combined Savings**: $425.37/month or $2,552 over 6 months

**Auto-Scaling Policies**:
- Scale down during low-traffic periods (nights): **15% compute savings** = $109.32/month
- Right-size instances based on utilization: **10% additional savings** = $72.88/month
- **Combined Savings**: $182.20/month or $1,093 over 6 months

**Storage Optimization**:
- Lifecycle policies for S3 (move to IA after 30 days): **20% savings** = $2.18/month
- EBS snapshot management (delete old snapshots): **10% savings** = $9.60/month
- **Combined Savings**: $11.78/month or $71 over 6 months

**Total Phase 3 Savings**: $3,716 over 6 months

### Projected 12-Month Cost with Optimizations

- **Months 1-6 (with immediate optimizations)**: $1,136.46 + ($3,423.33 - $1,209) = **$3,350.79**
- **Months 7-12 (with all optimizations)**: ($19,349.82 - $3,716) = **$15,633.82**
- **Total Optimized 12-Month Cost**: **$18,984.61**

**Savings vs. Baseline**: $23,909.61 - $18,984.61 = **$4,925 (21% reduction)**
