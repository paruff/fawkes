# Value Stream Mapping (VSM)

This section covers value stream mapping documentation, metrics, and optimization for the Fawkes platform.

## Overview

Value Stream Mapping helps visualize and optimize the flow of work from idea to production, identifying bottlenecks and waste in the delivery process.

## Documentation

- [Value Stream Mapping](value-stream-mapping.md) - VSM methodology and practices

## Implementation

- [VSM Implementation Complete](../implementation-summaries/VSM_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md) - Completed VSM implementation
- [VSM Implementation Summary](../implementation-summaries/VSM_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md) - Technical implementation details

### DORA Metrics

VSM directly supports DORA metrics measurement:

- **Deployment Frequency** - How often work flows to production
- **Lead Time for Changes** - Time through the value stream
- **Change Failure Rate** - Quality indicators in the stream
- **Time to Restore Service** - Recovery time measurement
