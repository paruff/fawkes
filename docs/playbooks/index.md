# Playbooks

Playbooks are **consultant-ready guides** that combine the Diátaxis documentation framework into complete, actionable implementation packages. Each playbook follows a structured format designed to help consultants deliver successful Fawkes implementations while communicating business value to stakeholders.

## Playbook Structure

Every playbook follows the same five-section structure, mapped to Diátaxis quadrants:

| Section | Diátaxis Quadrant | Purpose |
|---------|------------------|---------|
| **I. Business Objective** | Explanation / Conceptual | Defines the "why"—the risk mitigated, compliance goal achieved, and value to the client |
| **II. Technical Prerequisites** | Reference | Lists necessary Fawkes components and versions, linking to detailed Reference documentation |
| **III. Implementation Steps** | How-to Guide (Core) | Step-by-step procedure to execute the objective using Fawkes components |
| **IV. Validation & Success Metrics** | How-to Guide / Reference | Instructions to verify outcomes (e.g., checking Kyverno reports, viewing DORA metrics) |
| **V. Client Presentation Talking Points** | Explanation / Conceptual | Ready-to-use business language for communicating success to client executives |
