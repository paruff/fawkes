# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This section contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting key architectural decisions made for the Fawkes platform.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help teams understand why decisions were made and provide valuable context for future changes.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

- **Title**: Short noun phrase describing the decision
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: The issue motivating the decision
- **Decision**: The change being proposed or implemented
- **Consequences**: The resulting context after applying the decision

## Creating New ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. Copy the ADR template
2. Fill in all sections with clear, concise information
3. Number sequentially (e.g., `0001-use-markdown-for-docs.md`)
4. Submit for review with the related code changes

## Existing ADRs

Browse the ADRs in this directory to understand:

- Why certain technologies were chosen
- Trade-offs considered in key decisions
- Evolution of the platform architecture
- Deprecated approaches and their replacements
