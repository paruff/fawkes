# ADR-019: User Research & Feedback Collection System

## Status

Accepted

## Context

ADR-018 established the SPACE framework for _quantitative_ measurement of developer experience. However, numbers alone cannot tell the complete story. Metrics show _what_ is happening but rarely explain _why_. To build a truly user-centric platform, we need deep qualitative insights to complement our quantitative metrics.

**The 2025 DORA Report Finding**:

> “User-centric focus is THE differentiator. Without it, AI adoption can have a negative impact on team performance.”

**What “User-Centric” Actually Means**:

- Regular direct contact with developers (our users)
- Understanding their goals, pain points, and workflows
- Validating assumptions before building features
- Closing the feedback loop: “You said X, we did Y”
- Treating the platform as a product, developers as customers

**Current State - Critical Gaps**:

- ❌ No systematic user interviews
- ❌ No user journey mapping
- ❌ No usability testing of platform features
- ❌ No process for collecting/triaging feedback
- ❌ Platform decisions made by platform team in isolation
- ❌ Developers have no clear way to influence roadmap

**Why This Matters for Fawkes**:

1. **AI Amplification**: User-centric focus amplifies AI benefits (DORA finding)
1. **Avoid “Build It and They Won’t Come”**: Features nobody asked for = wasted effort
1. **Early Problem Detection**: Catch issues before they become widespread
1. **Build Trust**: Developers feel heard when their feedback shapes the platform
1. **Competitive Advantage**: Great DevEx attracts and retains top talent

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive **User Research & Feedback Collection System** with three interconnected components:

1. **Continuous Feedback Channels** (always-on, low-friction)
1. **Structured User Research** (proactive, scheduled)
1. **Feedback Processing Pipeline** (turning insights into action)

## Component 1: Continuous Feedback Channels

### 1.1 In-Platform Feedback Widget (Backstage Plugin)

**What**: A persistent feedback button in Backstage that allows developers to submit feedback in <30 seconds without leaving their workflow.

**Implementation**:

```typescript
// Backstage Plugin: @fawkes/plugin-feedback
// Appears in every Backstage page header

interface FeedbackSubmission {
  type: "bug" | "friction" | "feature-request" | "praise";
  category: "ci-cd" | "gitops" | "docs" | "dojo" | "other";
  description: string;
  context: {
    page: string;
    timestamp: Date;
    userRole: string;
    anonymized: boolean;
  };
  sentiment: "positive" | "neutral" | "negative";
}
```

**Features**:

- One-click access from any Backstage page
- Pre-categorized feedback types (reduces friction)
- Optional anonymous submission
- Automatically captures context (page, time, user role)
- AI-powered sentiment analysis
- “Thank you” confirmation with ticket number

**Example Flow**:

```
[User clicks "Give Feedback" button in Backstage header]

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Quick Feedback (30 seconds)            │
│                                          │
│  What type of feedback?                 │
│  ( ) Bug - Something's broken           │
│  (•) Friction - Something's annoying    │
│  ( ) Feature Request - I need...        │
│  ( ) Praise - Something's great!        │
│                                          │
│  Which area?                             │
│  [Dropdown: CI/CD, GitOps, Docs, etc.]  │
│                                          │
│  Tell us more: (required)                │
│  [Text area - 50-500 characters]         │
│                                          │
│  [✓] Make this feedback anonymous        │
│                                          │
│  [Cancel]  [Submit Feedback]             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

[After submission]
✅ Thanks! Your feedback has been recorded as FEEDBACK-1234.
   The platform team reviews all feedback monthly.
```

**Target**: 50+ feedback submissions per month (for 100 developers = 50% monthly participation)

### 1.2 Mattermost #platform-feedback Channel

**What**: A dedicated, monitored channel where developers can share feedback, ask questions, and discuss platform topics.

**Purpose**:

- Lower-friction than formal feedback form
- Enables peer-to-peer discussion
- Platform team can ask clarifying questions
- Public transparency (everyone sees responses)

**Guidelines**:

- Platform team commits to <24 hour response time
- All feedback is acknowledged, even if not immediately actionable
- Emoji reactions for quick validation (“👍 we hear you”)
- Monthly summary post of feedback received and actions taken

**Example Interaction**:

```
@developer_alice [10:23 AM]
The Jenkins build for my service is taking 45 minutes now.
It used to be 15 minutes last month. Anyone else seeing this?
🐌

@platform_engineer [10:41 AM]
Thanks for flagging @developer_alice! We'll investigate.
Can you share which service? (DM if sensitive)

@developer_bob [11:02 AM]
Same issue here. My builds went from 12 mins → 35 mins
Seems like it started after the Jenkins upgrade last week?

@platform_engineer [11:15 AM]
Good catch on the timing. We upgraded Jenkins on Oct 28th.
I'll check if we inadvertently changed build parallelism settings.
Created ticket: FAWKES-567. Will update here by EOD.

@platform_engineer [4:30 PM]
Update: Found the issue. Jenkins upgrade reset parallel build
settings. Fix deployed. Builds should be back to normal speed now.
@developer_alice @developer_bob can you confirm?

@developer_alice [4:45 PM]
Confirmed! Back to 16 minutes. Thanks! 🎉
```

### 1.3 Bi-Weekly Office Hours

**What**: Scheduled 1-hour sessions where developers can drop in to discuss platform topics, demo features, or raise concerns.

**Format**:

- Every other Wednesday, 2:00-3:00 PM (recorded for async viewing)

```

**Target**: 10-15 attendees per session, 40+ watching recording

### 1.4 GitHub Issues (Feature Requests)

**What**: A public repository (`fawkes/platform-feedback`) where developers can submit feature requests, vote on proposals, and discuss implementations.

**Process**:

1. Developer opens issue with feature request template
1. Platform team labels and categorizes (P0/P1/P2)
1. Community can upvote (👍 reactions)
1. Monthly review: Top 3 upvoted features → roadmap consideration
1. Status updates posted as comments
1. Closed with link to implementation or explanation if rejected

**Feature Request Template**:

```markdown
## Feature Request

**Problem Statement**:
What problem are you trying to solve? (Be specific)

**Proposed Solution**:
How would you like this to work?

**Alternatives Considered**:
What workarounds are you currently using?

**Impact**:
How many people would benefit? How often would this be used?

**Additional Context**:
Screenshots, examples, related issues?
```

**Success Metric**: 10+ feature requests per month, 80% receive response within 1 week

## Component 2: Structured User Research

### 2.1 Monthly User Interviews (5 per month)

**What**: One-on-one, semi-structured interviews with developers to deeply understand their workflows, pain points, and needs.

**Recruitment**:

- Stratified sampling: Mix of roles, teams, experience levels
- Rotate through teams (don’t interview same people repeatedly)
- $50 gift card incentive for 1-hour participation
- Opt-in via Mattermost announcement

**Interview Guide Template**:

```markdown
Fawkes User Interview Guide (60 minutes)

Introduction (5 min):

- Thank participant, explain purpose
- Emphasize: No right/wrong answers, all feedback valuable
- Confirm recording consent

Warm-Up (5 min):

- What's your role and team?
- How long have you been using Fawkes?
- On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate your overall experience?

Current Workflow (15 min):

- Walk me through your typical day using Fawkes
- What's the first thing you do in the morning?
- How do you deploy code from idea to production?
- [Screen share: Show me how you do X]

Pain Points (15 min):

- What's the most frustrating part of using Fawkes?
- When was the last time Fawkes slowed you down?
- If you could fix one thing tomorrow, what would it be?
- What workarounds have you developed?

AI Tools (10 min):

- Are you using AI coding assistants (Copilot, etc.)?
- How has AI changed your workflow?
- What would make AI tools more useful in Fawkes?

Aspirations (5 min):

- What does an ideal platform look like to you?
- What would make you recommend Fawkes to others?

Wrap-Up (5 min):

- Anything we haven't covered?
- Can we follow up if we have clarifying questions?
- Thank you + next steps
```

**Analysis Process**:

1. Transcribe interviews (automated via Otter.ai)
1. Qualitative coding: Tag themes (e.g., “Jenkins slow”, “docs unclear”, “AI helpful”)
1. Affinity mapping: Cluster similar feedback
1. Synthesis: Write 1-page summary per interview
1. Monthly report: Top 5 themes across all interviews

**Target**: 5 interviews per month = 60/year = ~60% of developers interviewed annually (for 100-person org)

### 2.2 User Journey Mapping Workshops (Quarterly)

**What**: Collaborative workshops where developers and platform team map the end-to-end journey of using Fawkes, identifying pain points and opportunities.

**Process**:

1. Select 1-2 key journeys (e.g., “Onboarding a new service”, “Deploying a hotfix”)
1. Invite 6-8 developers who’ve recently completed that journey
1. 2-hour workshop: Map stages, emotions, pain points, moments of delight
1. Platform team commits to addressing top 3 pain points

**Example Journey Map Output**:

```
Journey: Deploying Your First Service to Production

Stage 1: Setup
😊 Easy: Backstage template worked great
😐 Okay: Jenkins config was confusing but documentation helped
😢 Frustrating: Spent 2 hours debugging IAM permissions

Stage 2: First Deploy
😊 Easy: ArgoCD UI is intuitive
😢 Frustrating: No idea if deployment was successful (logs buried)
😡 Blocker: Deployment failed due to missing secret, took 4 hours to debug

Stage 3: Monitoring
😐 Okay: Grafana dashboard is powerful but overwhelming
😢 Frustrating: Can't tell if my service is healthy without asking SRE team

Top Pain Points:
1. IAM permissions are black magic (fix: better templates + error messages)
2. Deployment status is unclear (fix: real-time status in Backstage)
3. Monitoring setup is manual and confusing (fix: auto-generated dashboards)
```

### 2.3 Usability Testing (As Needed)

**What**: Observing developers trying to complete specific tasks with new or existing platform features.

**When to Use**:

- Before launching major new features (beta testing)
- After receiving complaints about existing features
- To validate design decisions

**Process**:

1. Define 3-5 realistic tasks (e.g., “Deploy a new microservice”)
1. Recruit 5 developers (diverse skill levels)
1. Observe remotely (screen share + think-aloud protocol)
1. Measure: Time to complete, errors, satisfaction rating
1. Identify usability issues and iterate design

**Example Test**:

```
Task: Create a new Python microservice and deploy it to staging

Success Criteria:
- Task completed without assistance: <20 minutes
- No critical errors (blockers that prevent completion)
- Satisfaction rating: >4/5

Observations (n=5 developers):
✅ All completed task in 12-18 minutes
⚠️  3/5 were confused by "Create Component" vs "Create Service" buttons
⚠️  4/5 didn't notice deployment status indicator
✅ Average satisfaction: 4.2/5

Recommendations:
1. Merge "Create Component" and "Create Service" into one flow
2. Make deployment status more prominent (add animation)
3. Add contextual help tooltip on first use
```

## Component 3: Feedback Processing Pipeline

### 3.1 Feedback Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE feedback (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'bug', 'friction', 'feature-request', 'praise'
  category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'ci-cd', 'gitops', 'docs', 'dojo', 'other'
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  source VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'widget', 'mattermost', 'interview', 'github'

  -- Context
  user_id VARCHAR(100), -- NULL if anonymous
  user_role VARCHAR(50),
  page_context VARCHAR(200), -- Which Backstage page?
  timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),

  -- Analysis
  sentiment VARCHAR(20), -- 'positive', 'neutral', 'negative' (AI-generated)
  themes TEXT[], -- e.g., ['performance', 'documentation', 'jenkins']
  impact_score INT, -- 1-5 based on affected users + frequency

  -- Lifecycle
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'new', -- 'new', 'triaged', 'in-progress', 'resolved', 'wont-fix'
  assigned_to VARCHAR(100),
  resolution_notes TEXT,
  resolved_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_feedback_status ON feedback(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_feedback_category ON feedback(category);
CREATE INDEX idx_feedback_timestamp ON feedback(timestamp DESC);
```

### 3.2 Automated Analysis (AI-Powered)

**Sentiment Analysis**:

```python
# Using OpenAI API for sentiment classification
def analyze_sentiment(feedback_text):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "Classify sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative."},
            {"role": "user", "content": feedback_text},
        ],
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content  # 'positive' | 'neutral' | 'negative'
```

**Theme Extraction**:

```python
# Identify common themes across feedback
def extract_themes(feedback_batch):
    prompt = f"""
    Analyze these {len(feedback_batch)} feedback items and identify 3-5 recurring themes.

    Feedback:
    {format_feedback(feedback_batch)}

    Return themes as a JSON array, e.g., ["performance", "documentation", "onboarding"]
    """
    # Returns: ['jenkins-slow', 'backstage-search', 'dojo-outdated', ...]
```

**Impact Scoring Algorithm**:

```python
def calculate_impact_score(feedback):
    score = 0

    # How many users mention similar issues?
    score += count_similar_feedback(feedback) * 2  # 0-10 points

    # Severity (based on type)
    severity_weights = {"bug": 3, "friction": 2, "feature-request": 1, "praise": 0}
    score += severity_weights[feedback.type]

    # Sentiment (negative = more urgent)
    if feedback.sentiment == "negative":
        score += 2

    # Recency (recent = more relevant)
    days_old = (now() - feedback.timestamp).days
    if days_old < 7:
        score += 3
    elif days_old < 30:
        score += 1

    return min(score, 10)  # Cap at 10
```

1. Integrate with roadmap planning tools
1. Measure impact: Are we closing the loop effectively?

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **User-Centric Culture**: Platform team stays connected to developer needs
1. **Early Problem Detection**: Catch issues before they become crises
1. **Higher Trust**: Developers feel heard and valued
1. **Better Prioritization**: Roadmap driven by validated user needs, not assumptions
1. **Continuous Learning**: Platform team develops deep domain expertise
1. **Competitive Advantage**: Great DevEx attracts and retains talent
1. **AI Readiness**: User-centric foundation amplifies AI benefits (DORA finding)
1. **Reduced Waste**: Don’t build features nobody wants
1. **Faster Adoption**: Developers embrace platform when they influence it
1. **Measurable Impact**: Can prove platform value with qualitative + quantitative data

### Negative

1. **Time Investment**: ~20% of platform team time on research and analysis
1. **Expectation Management**: Must deliver on feedback or risk losing trust
1. **Potentially Overwhelming**: Too much feedback can be paralyzing
1. **Interview Recruiting**: May struggle to get volunteers (mitigate with incentives)
1. **Analysis Burden**: Qualitative research requires skill and effort
1. **Difficult Tradeoffs**: Must say “no” to some feature requests

### Neutral

1. **Requires Facilitation Skills**: Platform team needs training on research methods
1. **Cultural Shift**: Treating developers as users requires leadership buy-in
