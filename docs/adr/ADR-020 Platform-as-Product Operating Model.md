# ADR-020: Platform-as-Product Operating Model

## Status
Accepted

## Context

Traditional platform teams operate as "service providers" responding to tickets. The 2025 DORA Report shows this reactive model fails to deliver great developer experience. We must treat Fawkes as an internal product with developers as customers.

## Decision

Adopt **Platform-as-Product** operating model with:
- Dedicated product manager for platform
- Quarterly OKRs driven by developer needs (not tickets)
- Product roadmap visible in Backstage
- Monthly demo days showcasing new features
- Developer advisory board (5-7 developers, rotating)

**Key Practices**:
- User research informs roadmap (not HiPPO decisions)
- Measure platform success by NPS, adoption, DORA metrics
- "You build it, you support it" (platform team owns platform)
- Quarterly business reviews with leadership (prove ROI)

## Consequences

**Positive**: Better features, higher adoption, developer trust
**Negative**: Requires product management skills, cultural shift
