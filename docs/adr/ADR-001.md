# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the Fawkes community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being patient with new contributors and helping them learn
* Celebrating others' successes and contributions
* Assuming good intent and asking clarifying questions
* Providing credit and recognition where it's due

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Dismissing or belittling others' contributions or concerns
* Sustained disruption of discussions, events, or community activities
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

## Our Responsibilities

Community leaders and maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including but not limited to:

* GitHub repositories (issues, pull requests, discussions, wiki)
* Community chat platforms (Slack, Discord)
* Mailing lists and email communications
* Social media channels (official Fawkes accounts)
* In-person events (meetups, conferences, workshops)
* Virtual events (webinars, office hours, live streams)
* Any other forums created by the project team which the community uses for communication

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**conduct@fawkes-project.org**

You may also use GitHub's built-in private vulnerability reporting feature to report Code of Conduct violations confidentially.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### What to Include in a Report

When reporting an incident, please include as much of the following information as possible:

* Your contact information (so we can get in touch with you)
* Names (real, usernames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
* Your account of what occurred
* If you believe this incident is ongoing
* Any other information that may be helpful
* Links to publicly available records (e.g., GitHub comments, mailing list archives)
* Date and time of the incident

### Confidentiality

All reports will be kept confidential. In some cases, we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Enforcement Process

1. **Report Received**: Community leaders acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
2. **Initial Review**: Community leaders review the report within 48 hours
3. **Investigation**: Gather additional information if needed (3-7 days)
4. **Decision**: Enforcement decision made by 2/3 vote of community leaders
5. **Action**: Enforcement action taken and parties notified
6. **Appeal**: Option to appeal decision within 14 days
7. **Documentation**: Incident documented for future reference (confidentially)

## Appeals

Any individual affected by an enforcement decision may appeal by contacting:

**conduct-appeals@fawkes-project.org**

Appeals will be reviewed by community leaders who were not involved in the original decision. The appeal review will be completed within 14 days, and the decision will be final.
