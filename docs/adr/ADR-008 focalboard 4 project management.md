# ADR-008: Focalboard for Project Management

## Status
**Accepted** - October 7, 2025

## Context

Fawkes is a comprehensive Internal Product Delivery Platform that integrates infrastructure, collaboration, learning, and project management. While we've addressed collaboration needs with Mattermost (ADR-007), teams need integrated project management capabilities to:

- **Track Platform Work**: Sprint planning, roadmap visualization, backlog management
- **Manage Product Delivery**: Feature planning, release management, dependency tracking
- **Coordinate Dojo Learning**: Track learner progress, module completion, assessment status
- **Visualize Workflows**: Kanban boards, calendars, tables for different team needs
- **Enable Self-Service**: Teams manage their own work without external tools

### The Need for Integrated Project Management

**Current Gap**: Teams using Fawkes must use external tools for:
- **Sprint Planning**: Jira, Azure DevOps, Linear, or spreadsheets
- **Roadmap Visualization**: Separate roadmapping tools (ProductPlan, Aha!)
- **Task Management**: Trello, Asana, Monday.com, or GitHub Projects
- **Learner Progress Tracking**: Manual spreadsheets or LMS platforms
- **Resource Planning**: Disconnected from delivery platform

**Problems with External Tools**:
- **Context Switching**: Jump between platforms (Fawkes → Jira → Confluence)
- **Integration Overhead**: Custom integrations required, often fragile
- **Data Silos**: Work tracking separate from actual delivery metrics
- **Access Control**: Different permission models, SSO complexity
- **Cost**: Commercial tools expensive at scale (Jira: $7-14/user/month)
- **Vendor Lock-In**: Proprietary data formats, migration challenges

### Requirements for Project Management Tool

1. **Self-Hosted & Open Source**: Aligns with Fawkes values, data sovereignty
2. **Native Mattermost Integration**: Seamless with our collaboration platform
3. **Multiple View Types**: Boards (Kanban), tables, calendar, gallery
4. **Dojo Integration**: Track learner progress, module completion, assessments
5. **DORA Metrics Connection**: Link work items to deployments and metrics
6. **Flexible & Lightweight**: Not overly complex like Jira, but powerful enough
7. **Developer-Friendly**: API for automation, CLI support, GitOps integration
8. **Template System**: Pre-built templates for sprints, roadmaps, dojo tracking
9. **Real-Time Collaboration**: Multiple users editing simultaneously
10. **Mobile Support**: iOS and Android apps for on-the-go updates

### Forces at Play

**Technical Forces**:
- Need to track both platform development and team usage
- Dojo learner progress requires structured tracking
- Sprint planning needs integration with CI/CD metrics
- Multiple stakeholders with different view preferences

**Business Forces**:
- Cost consciousness (avoid per-user fees)
- Data sovereignty and compliance requirements
- Desire for unified platform experience
- Open source community expectations

**User Experience Forces**:
- Teams familiar with Trello/Jira/Asana expect similar UX
- Learning curve for new tools creates friction
- Mobile access increasingly important
- Real-time collaboration expected

**Integration Forces**:
- Must integrate deeply with Mattermost (discussions, notifications)
- Should connect to DORA metrics and deployments
- Needs SSO with platform authentication
- API for automation and custom workflows

## Decision

**We will use Focalboard as the integrated project management tool for Fawkes.**

Specifically:
- **Focalboard bundled with Mattermost** (native integration)
- **Self-hosted deployment** in Kubernetes alongside Mattermost
- **Deep integration** with Mattermost channels (board discussions, notifications)
- **Custom templates** for dojo tracking, sprint planning, platform roadmaps
- **Backstage integration** via iframe or custom plugin for visibility

### Rationale

1. **Native Mattermost Integration**: Focalboard is developed by Mattermost, Inc. and integrates seamlessly:
   - Built into Mattermost (no separate deployment complexity)
   - Linked discussions (board cards → Mattermost threads)
   - Unified notifications (updates appear in Mattermost)
   - Single SSO and permission model
   - Share boards directly in channels

2. **Open Source & Self-Hosted**: Fully open source (MIT/Apache 2.0), aligns with Fawkes values, complete control over data

3. **Notion-Like Experience**: Modern, intuitive UX inspired by Notion:
   - Flexible databases with custom properties
   - Multiple views (board, table, calendar, gallery)
   - Rich content (markdown, embeds, checklists)
   - Templates for quick setup

4. **Perfect for Dojo Tracking**: Ideal for tracking learner progress:
   - Board per belt level (White, Yellow, Green, Brown, Black)
   - Cards represent learners with completion status
   - Custom properties: score, time spent, assessment results
   - Calendar view for cohort scheduling
   - Gallery view for learner profiles

5. **Lightweight & Fast**: Unlike Jira, Focalboard is lightweight:
   - Fast page loads, responsive UI
   - Simple setup, minimal configuration
   - Not overly complex for small teams
   - Scales well to large teams when needed

6. **Developer-Friendly**:
   - REST API for automation
   - Import/export in JSON format
   - Can integrate with CI/CD pipelines
   - Archive and backup easily

7. **Cost Effectiveness**:
   - Free with Mattermost (no additional cost)
   - No per-user fees
   - Only infrastructure costs (already paying for Mattermost)

8. **Multiple Use Cases**:
   - **Sprint Planning**: Kanban boards for backlog → in progress → done
   - **Roadmap Visualization**: Timeline view for quarters/releases
   - **Dojo Tracking**: Learner progress boards with custom properties
   - **Incident Management**: Board for tracking incidents and postmortems
   - **Team OKRs**: Tables for objectives and key results
   - **Content Calendar**: Calendar view for blog posts, webinars

9. **Mobile Support**: Native mobile apps for iOS and Android (via Mattermost apps)

10. **Active Development**: Actively maintained by Mattermost with regular updates

11. **Familiar UX**: Similar to Trello/Notion/Asana, reducing learning curve

   - Build custom dashboards using REST API
   - Integrate with DORA metrics for delivery insights
   - Create weekly/monthly summary reports

3. **Time Tracking**:
   - Use custom properties for estimated/actual time
   - Integrate with external time tracking if needed
   - Consider building simple time-tracking plugin

4. **Workflow Complexity**:
   - Keep workflows simple (aligns with agile principles)
   - Use Mattermost bot commands for complex automations
   - Document standard workflows in templates

5. **Dependency Management**:
   - Use linked cards feature for simple dependencies
   - Document complex dependencies in card descriptions
   - Consider building dependency visualization

6. **Adoption**:
   - Create video tutorials
   - Provide pre-built templates
   - Show integration benefits (Mattermost notifications, DORA links)
   - Run pilot with one team before broader rollout

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Jira (SaaS or Self-Hosted)

**Pros**:
- Industry-standard for software teams
- Extremely powerful and feature-rich
- Extensive reporting and analytics
- Huge marketplace of plugins (1,000+)
- Advanced workflow engine
- Time tracking, resource management, roadmaps
- Familiar to most development teams
- Strong integration ecosystem

**Cons**:
- **Cost**: $7.75-$14.50/user/month SaaS, or $42,000+ for self-hosted Data Center

```
[Focalboard Bot] 📋 Card moved in "Sprint 01"
@john moved "Implement DORA metrics" 
From: In Progress → Review
Board: https://mattermost.fawkes.io/boards/abc123
```

**2. Card Discussions**:
```
User clicks "Discuss in Mattermost" on card
→ Creates thread in linked channel
→ Thread automatically linked back to card
→ Comments sync bidirectionally
```

**3. Daily Stand-up Automation**:
```
[Focalboard Bot] 📊 Daily Stand-up - Sprint 01
Cards completed yesterday: 3
Cards in progress: 7
Blocked cards: 1 ⚠️

@alice: 2 cards in review
@bob: Working on "Security scanning" (blocked)
@carol: Completed "Deploy Backstage"
```

### Backstage Integration

- **Phase 1**: Iframe embed in Backstage (boards visible in developer portal)
- **Phase 2**: Custom Backstage plugin (`@fawkes/plugin-focalboard`)
- **Phase 3**: Deep integration (create cards from Backstage, link to services)

### DORA Metrics Integration

Link board cards to deployments:
```javascript
// When deployment completes
POST /focalboard/api/cards/{cardId}/properties
{
  "deployed": true,
  "deployment_time": "2025-10-07T14:30:00Z",
  "dora_lead_time": "8h 42m",
  "deployment_id": "deploy-12345"
}
```

### Mobile Experience

- Access via Mattermost mobile app
- Focalboard integrated in Mattermost mobile (iOS/Android)
- Full board editing on mobile
- Push notifications for card updates
- Offline support with sync

### Backup & Data Export

- **Backup**: Included in Mattermost backup strategy
- **Export**: JSON format for all boards
- **Import**: Can import from Trello, Asana, Notion
- **Git Backup**: Export boards to Git for version control

### Resource Requirements

**Included in Mattermost deployment**:
- No additional CPU/memory beyond Mattermost
- Shares PostgreSQL database
- File attachments use same storage (S3/MinIO)
- ~100MB additional storage per 100 active boards

### Performance Considerations

- Board loading: <1 second for boards with <1000 cards
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Card search indexed for fast queries
- Archive old boards to improve performance

## Monitoring This Decision

We will revisit this ADR if:
- Focalboard becomes unmaintained or development slows significantly
- Critical features remain missing after 12 months
- Performance issues arise that can't be resolved
- A superior open source alternative emerges with Mattermost integration
- Community adoption is below 50% (teams prefer external tools)

**Next Review Date**: April 7, 2026 (6 months)

## Notes

### Why Focalboard Over Jira?

The most common question: "Why not use Jira, the industry standard?"

**Three key reasons**:

1. **Integration**: Focalboard's native Mattermost integration creates unified experience. Jira requires complex external integrations.

2. **Cost & Values**: Open source and self-hosted aligns with Fawkes values. Jira's licensing costs don't scale for open source community.

3. **Simplicity**: Most teams don't need Jira's complexity. Focalboard's simplicity is a feature, not a limitation. Start simple, scale up as needed.

### Focalboard's Evolution

Focalboard started as standalone project, acquired by Mattermost in 2021. Now:
- Core part of Mattermost platform
- Active development (monthly releases)
- Growing feature set
- Increasing adoption
- Path to maturity clear

### Enterprise Considerations

While Focalboard is free, some advanced features require Mattermost Enterprise:
- Advanced permissions and compliance
- SAML authentication
- Data retention policies
- Advanced audit logging

For open source Fawkes: Start with free version, upgrade if enterprise adopters need these features.
