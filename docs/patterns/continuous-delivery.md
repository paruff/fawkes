# Continuous Delivery Pattern

![CD Pipeline](../assets/images/patterns/cd-pipeline.png){ width="600" }

Continuous Delivery (CD) is a software development practice where code changes are automatically prepared for production release. According to DORA research, it's one of the key capabilities that drives high performance in technology organizations.

## Core Principles

| Principle | Description | Implementation |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| ![](../assets/images/icons/trunk.png){ width="24" } **Trunk-Based Development** | Work in small batches with short-lived branches | Git workflow with feature flags |
| ![](../assets/images/icons/automation.png){ width="24" } **Automation** | Automate build, test, and deployment processes | Jenkins, GitHub Actions |
| ![](../assets/images/icons/testing.png){ width="24" } **Comprehensive Testing** | Implement automated testing at all levels | Selenium, JUnit, Cypress |
| ![](../assets/images/icons/gitops.png){ width="24" } **GitOps** | Use Git as single source of truth | ArgoCD, Flux |

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Version Control Practices

```bash
# Trunk-based development workflow
git checkout -b feature/small-change
# Make small, incremental changes
git commit -am "feat: add new feature behind flag"
git push origin feature/small-change
# Merge to trunk within 24 hours
```

### 2. Deployment Pipeline

```yaml
# Example Jenkins Pipeline
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'make build'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            parallel {
                stage('Unit') {
                    steps { sh 'make test-unit' }
                }
                stage('Integration') {
                    steps { sh 'make test-integration' }
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'make deploy'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Feature Flags

```java
public class FeatureFlags {
    private static final String FLAG_NEW_FEATURE = "new-feature";
    
    public boolean isEnabled(String flag) {
        return LaunchDarkly.client().boolVariation(flag, user, false);
    }
}
```

## Key Metrics

Based on DORA research, track these metrics:

| Metric | Elite Performance | Implementation |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| Deployment Frequency | Multiple deploys per day | `deployment_frequency = deploys / time_period` |
| Lead Time for Changes | Less than one hour | `lead_time = time_to_production - commit_time` |
| Change Failure Rate | 0-15% | `failure_rate = failed_deploys / total_deploys` |
| Time to Restore | Less than one hour | `mttr = restore_time - failure_time` |

## Best Practices

### 1. Build Process
- Use deterministic builds
- Cache dependencies
- Implement parallel processing

### 2. Testing Strategy
- Maintain test pyramid
- Automate all tests
- Include security testing

### 3. Deployment Process
```yaml
# Example ArgoCD Application
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: fawkes-app
spec:
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/paruff/fawkes.git
    path: kubernetes
    targetRevision: HEAD
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: production
```

## Common Anti-Patterns

❌ **Avoid These Practices:**
- Long-lived feature branches
- Manual deployment steps
- Infrequent integration
- Environment-specific builds

✅ **Instead Do This:**
- Merge to trunk daily
- Automate everything
- Practice continuous integration
- Build once, deploy many times

## Tools Integration

| Category | Tools | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| CI/CD | Jenkins, GitHub Actions | Pipeline automation |
| Version Control | Git | Source code management |
| Testing | Selenium, JUnit | Automated testing |
| Deployment | Spinnaker, ArgoCD | Deployment automation |
| Monitoring | Prometheus, Grafana | Performance tracking |
