# Explanation

Explanation documentation is **understanding-oriented**. It clarifies concepts, provides background, and helps you understand why things work the way they do.

## What You'll Find Here

Explanation content in Fawkes is designed to:

- Provide context and background knowledge
- Explain concepts, architecture decisions, and design choices
- Help you understand the "why" behind features
- Connect different parts of the platform together
