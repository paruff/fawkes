# Fawkes Project Charter

## Project Name
**Fawkes** - An Open Source Internal Delivery Platform

## Vision
To become the leading open-source Internal Delivery Platform that empowers organizations to achieve elite DORA performance while fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement in platform engineering.

## Mission
Provide a production-ready, comprehensive Internal Delivery Platform that:
- Enables rapid, secure software delivery through automation and best practices
- Makes DORA metrics a first-class citizen with automated collection and visualization
- Integrates learning and skill development through a dojo-style curriculum
- Supports multi-cloud infrastructure with GitOps and Infrastructure as Code
- Prioritizes security through DevSecOps practices and zero-trust principles
- Creates an exceptional developer experience that reduces cognitive load

## Problem Statement

Organizations struggle to build effective Internal Developer Platforms due to:

1. **Complexity**: Platform engineering requires expertise across dozens of tools and practices
2. **Integration Challenges**: Stitching together CI/CD, observability, security, and deployment tools is time-consuming
3. **Metrics Blind Spots**: Teams lack visibility into DORA metrics and platform effectiveness
4. **Skills Gap**: Platform engineering skills are scarce; teams need learning resources integrated with tools
5. **Reinventing the Wheel**: Every organization builds similar platforms, duplicating effort
6. **Vendor Lock-in**: Commercial platforms create dependencies and limit customization

## Solution

Fawkes provides an opinionated, integrated platform that includes:

**Core Platform Capabilities**:
- Kubernetes-based infrastructure provisioning (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- GitOps workflows for declarative infrastructure and application management
- CI/CD pipelines with golden path templates
- Automated security scanning and compliance checks
- Comprehensive observability stack (metrics, logs, traces)
- Developer portal (Backstage) for self-service and discovery
- Deployment strategies (blue-green, canary, progressive delivery)

**Differentiators**:
- **DORA Metrics Automation**: Automated collection and visualization of all four key metrics
- **Dojo Learning Curriculum**: Integrated learning paths aligned with platform capabilities
- **Certification Integration**: Aligned with Platform Engineering University certifications
- **Open Source & Extensible**: No vendor lock-in, community-driven development
- **Security-First**: Comprehensive scanning, policy-as-code, zero-trust roadmap
- **Multi-Cloud Native**: Designed for multi-cloud from the start

- **Cost Savings**: Infrastructure efficiency vs. manual platform building

## Guiding Principles

### 1. Developer Experience is Paramount
Every feature must improve developer productivity, reduce cognitive load, or enable self-service.

### 2. Measure Everything
If it can't be measured, it can't be improved. Build observability into every component.

### 3. Security is Non-Negotiable
Security scanning, policy enforcement, and compliance are built-in, not bolt-on.

### 4. Learn While Building
The platform doubles as a learning environment with integrated curriculum.

### 5. Community Over Features
A healthy, engaged community is more valuable than a feature-complete platform.

### 6. Open by Default
Decisions, roadmap, metrics, and discussions are public unless privacy requires otherwise.

### 7. Opinionated but Extensible
Provide golden paths for 80% of use cases; allow customization for the other 20%.

### 8. Multi-Cloud from Day One
Design for cloud portability even if initial implementation is AWS-only.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Kubernetes-based infrastructure automation
- CI/CD pipelines and deployment strategies
- Observability (metrics, logs, traces)
- Security scanning and policy enforcement
- Developer portal and self-service catalog
- GitOps workflows
- DORA metrics automation
- Learning curriculum and certification alignment
- Multi-cloud support (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Documentation and community building

### Out of Scope (Explicitly)
- Application frameworks or languages (we provide templates, not frameworks)
- Source control management (we integrate with GitHub/GitLab, not replace them)
- Project management tools (we integrate, not replace)
- Business-specific workflows (keep platform generic, extensible)
- On-premises only deployments (cloud-first, on-prem possible but not primary)

### Future Consideration
- Edge computing and IoT deployments
- Machine learning platform capabilities
- FinOps and cost optimization features
- Compliance automation (SOC2, HIPAA, etc.)
- Advanced chaos engineering integration

## Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Integration complexity delays MVP | High | Start with minimal integrations, prioritize stability over features |
| Scalability issues at enterprise scale | High | Design for scale from day one, conduct load testing early |
| Security vulnerabilities in dependencies | High | Automated scanning, regular updates, security-first culture |

### Community Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Maintainer burnout | Critical | Grow maintainer team early, establish rotation schedules |
| Low adoption / community interest | High | Invest heavily in documentation, marketing, and partnerships |
| Competing projects fragment efforts | Medium | Differentiate clearly, collaborate where possible |

### Business Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Insufficient funding for infrastructure | Medium | Seek cloud credits, CNCF support, sponsorships |
| Certification partnerships fail | Medium | Maintain standalone value, diversify partnerships |
| Enterprise concerns about support | Medium | Build professional services ecosystem, offer paid support options |
