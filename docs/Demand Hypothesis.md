# Demand Hypothesis

Based on the defined persona (Improvement-Driven Leader) and their Jobs to Be Done, we hypothesize the following about the demand for a service that provides DORA metrics visualization:

**Hypothesis Statement:**

**We believe that Improvement-Driven Leaders within software development organizations will find significant value in a service that provides easily accessible, objective visualization of DORA metrics.**

**Because:**

*   DORA metrics (change lead time, deployment frequency, change fail percentage, failed deployment recovery time) are **globally recognized and validated indicators** of software delivery performance and overall organizational outcomes [6, 7].
*   Improvement-Driven Leaders need **objective data** to understand the current state of their software delivery process and identify specific areas for improvement [5, 8].
*   There is a common pain point where **management doesn't fully understand the software process or the challenges** faced by development and operations teams, leading to misaligned expectations and pressure [1-3].
*   Providing **end-to-end dashboards for stakeholders** to view performance is a key practice for mitigating challenges and enabling **data-driven decision-making** [8].
*   Metrics are a **requirement for excellence** and facilitate informed decision-making [8].
*   Organizations often struggle to **effectively collect and present** these critical metrics from their existing toolchains [8, 14-16].
*   A service focused on delivering these core metrics addresses a fundamental need for **visibility and insight** necessary for an improvement-driven approach [5, 7].

**Therefore:**

*   Providing a clear, centralized view of DORA metrics will **solve a key pain point** for leaders struggling to measure and understand their team's performance.
*   This service will enable leaders to **make better decisions**, **justify investments** in process improvements, and **communicate performance** effectively across the organization.
*   The demand for such a service is driven by the need to **identify and address inefficiencies and bottlenecks** in the software delivery lifecycle, ultimately helping organizations get "better at getting better" [5].
*   While platforms like Backstage exist, a focused MVP on DORA metrics addresses the specific need for **performance visibility** directly, potentially with less initial overhead than a full IDP implementation, thus being valuable as a targeted solution for this persona.

**Validation Strategy (Implicit/Next Steps):**

*   Engage directly with potential customers (Improvement-Driven Leaders) to confirm these pain points and the perceived value of a DORA metrics dashboard [17].
*   Leverage tools and methods for identifying pain points such as surveys, interviews, analyzing forum discussions (like on Reddit) related to DevOps, performance, and management challenges [17-26].
*   Start with a DORA Quick Check style conversation [Conversation History] to assess current understanding and perceived needs regarding performance metrics.
