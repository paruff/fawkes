# Security

This document outlines the security model, practices, and recommendations for the Fawkes Internal Developer Platform (IDP).

---

## Principles

- **Least Privilege:** All components and users are granted only the permissions they need.
- **Separation of Duties:** Infrastructure, platform, and application responsibilities are separated.
- **Defense in Depth:** Multiple layers of security controls are implemented across the stack.
- **Transparency:** All security controls and configurations are documented and open for review.

---

## Secrets Management

- **Never commit secrets to version control.**
- Use secret management tools (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secret Manager, or Kubernetes Secrets).
- Store only encrypted secrets in infrastructure code; inject secrets at deploy time.
- Add secret files and templates to `.gitignore`.

---

## Identity and Access Management (IAM)

- Use cloud-native IAM (AWS IAM, Azure AD, GCP IAM) for resource access control.
- Use Kubernetes RBAC for fine-grained access within clusters.
- Rotate credentials and keys regularly.
- Use service accounts for automation and CI/CD, with minimal permissions.

---

## Network Security

- Deploy resources in private subnets where possible.
- Restrict public ingress using security groups, firewalls, and Kubernetes network policies.
- Use TLS/SSL for all service endpoints.
- Enable logging and monitoring for network traffic.

---

## Platform Security

- Enable audit logging for all infrastructure and platform components.
- Regularly update dependencies and base images to address vulnerabilities.
- Use vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., Trivy, Gitleaks) in CI/CD pipelines.
- Enforce code reviews and automated tests for all changes.

---

## Kubernetes Security

- Use namespaces to isolate workloads.
- Apply Pod Security Standards (PSS) or PodSecurityPolicies.
- Limit container privileges (no root, no privilege escalation).
- Use network policies to restrict pod-to-pod communication.
- Scan container images for vulnerabilities before deployment.

---

## CI/CD Security

- Store CI/CD credentials securely (never in code).
- Use environment variables or secret stores for pipeline secrets.
- Limit pipeline permissions to only required resources.
- Scan code and dependencies for vulnerabilities on every build.

---

## Monitoring and Incident Response

- Enable and monitor audit logs for all cloud and platform resources.
- Set up alerts for suspicious activity or failed authentication attempts.
- Document incident response procedures and regularly review them.

---

## User Responsibilities

- Use strong, unique passwords and enable MFA where possible.
- Report any suspected security issues to the project maintainers.
- Follow the [contributing guidelines](development.md) for secure code contributions.

---

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly by opening a private issue or contacting the maintainers directly.
