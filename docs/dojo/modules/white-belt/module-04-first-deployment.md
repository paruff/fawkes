### The Fawkes Deployment Pipeline

When you deploy on Fawkes, your code flows through a carefully orchestrated pipeline:

```
Developer → Git → Jenkins → Harbor → ArgoCD → Kubernetes → 🎉
   You     SCM    CI/CD    Registry  GitOps   Cluster    Live!
```

Let's break down each stage:

#### Stage 1: Code Commit (Git)

**What Happens**: You push code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)

**Behind the Scenes**:
- Git webhook triggers Jenkins
- Commit SHA becomes the version identifier
- Timestamp recorded (start of lead time measurement)

**Your Role**: `git push origin main`

**Time**: < 1 second

---

#### Stage 2: Build & Test (Jenkins)

**What Happens**: Jenkins automatically builds and tests your code

**Behind the Scenes**:
1. **Checkout**: Jenkins clones your repository
2. **Build**: Compiles code, runs tests
3. **Security Scan**: Checks for vulnerabilities (Trivy)
4. **Quality Check**: SonarQube analysis (if configured)
5. **Package**: Creates container image
6. **Push**: Uploads image to Harbor registry

**Your Role**: None! It's automated by the golden path pipeline.

**Time**: 3-8 minutes (depending on project size)

**Success Indicators**:
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ No critical security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Code quality meets threshold
- ✅ Container image tagged with commit SHA

---

#### Stage 3: Registry Storage (Harbor)

**What Happens**: Your container image is stored in Harbor registry

**Behind the Scenes**:
- Image tagged: `harbor.fawkes.local/myapp:abc123`
- Vulnerability scan runs automatically
- Image signed (cryptographic verification)
- Available for deployment

**Your Role**: None! Fully automated.

**Time**: < 30 seconds

**Important**: The image is immutable—same image moves through all environments (dev → staging → prod). This ensures consistency.

---

#### Stage 4: GitOps Deployment (ArgoCD)

**What Happens**: ArgoCD detects the new image and deploys to Kubernetes

**Behind the Scenes**:
1. **Detection**: ArgoCD polls Git repository every 3 minutes (or webhook triggers immediately)
2. **Sync**: Compares desired state (Git) with actual state (Kubernetes)
3. **Apply**: Creates/updates Kubernetes resources
4. **Health Check**: Monitors pod startup and readiness
5. **Metrics**: Records deployment event for DORA metrics

**Your Role**: Review sync status in ArgoCD UI

**Time**: 1-5 minutes (depending on pod startup time)

**Success Indicators**:
- ✅ Sync status: "Synced"
- ✅ Health status: "Healthy"
- ✅ Pods running: All replicas ready

---

#### Stage 5: Running Application (Kubernetes)

**What Happens**: Your application runs in Kubernetes, accessible via ingress

**Behind the Scenes**:
- Pods scheduled across nodes for HA
- Service provides stable network endpoint
- Ingress routes traffic from external load balancer
- Probes monitor health (liveness, readiness)
- Metrics collected by Prometheus
- Logs shipped to OpenSearch
- Traces sent to Jaeger

**Your Role**: Access application, verify functionality

**Time**: Immediate once pods are ready

**Success Indicators**:
- ✅ Application responds to requests
- ✅ Health check endpoints return 200 OK
- ✅ No errors in logs

---

### Golden Path Templates

Fawkes provides **golden path templates**—pre-configured application scaffolds that include everything you need:

**What's Included**:
- ✅ Application code structure
- ✅ Dockerfile (container image build)
- ✅ Jenkinsfile (CI/CD pipeline)
- ✅ Kubernetes manifests (deployment, service, ingress)
- ✅ Helm chart (configuration management)
- ✅ README with instructions
- ✅ Automated testing setup
- ✅ Monitoring and observability configuration

**Why Golden Paths?**
- **Consistency**: Every app follows the same patterns
- **Best Practices**: Security, testing, monitoring built-in
- **Speed**: Start from working example, customize as needed
- **Learning**: See how the pieces fit together

**Available Templates** (in Fawkes MVP):
- `spring-boot-api`: Java REST API with Spring Boot
- `python-flask-api`: Python REST API with Flask
- `nodejs-express-api`: Node.js REST API with Express
- `static-website`: Static HTML/CSS/JS site

---

### DORA Metrics: Automatic Capture

Every deployment automatically updates your DORA metrics:

**Deployment Frequency**:
- Incremented when ArgoCD successfully syncs to production
- Visible in real-time on DORA dashboard

**Lead Time for Changes**:
- Start: Git commit timestamp
- End: ArgoCD sync completion timestamp
- Calculated automatically, no manual tracking

**Change Failure Rate**:
- If deployment rolls back within 24 hours → counted as failure
- If incident created within 24 hours of deploy → counted as failure
- Visible as percentage on dashboard

**Mean Time to Restore (MTTR)**:
- Start: Incident created timestamp
- End: Incident resolved timestamp (successful deploy or rollback)
- Only measured if incident occurs

**No Manual Work Required**: The platform captures everything automatically.

---

### Common Deployment Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Direct to Production (MVP)
```
Git → Jenkins → Harbor → ArgoCD → Production
```
**When to Use**: MVP, small teams, low-risk changes  
**Risk Level**: Medium (no staging environment)

#### Pattern 2: Dev → Production (Recommended)
```
Git → Jenkins → Harbor → ArgoCD → Dev → Production
```
**When to Use**: Small teams, moderate risk  
**Risk Level**: Low (dev environment for testing)

#### Pattern 3: Full Pipeline (Enterprise)
```
Git → Jenkins → Harbor → ArgoCD → Dev → Staging → Production
```
**When to Use**: Large teams, high-risk changes, compliance requirements  
**Risk Level**: Very Low (multiple validation stages)

**Fawkes MVP**: Uses Pattern 1 or 2 by default. Pattern 3 configured in production.

---

### Troubleshooting: Where to Look

**Build Failed**:
- **Where**: Jenkins build logs
- **How**: Click on build number in Jenkins UI
- **Common Issues**: Test failures, dependency errors, Docker build errors

**Image Scan Failed**:
- **Where**: Harbor UI → Images → Scan Results
- **How**: Click on image tag, view vulnerabilities
- **Common Issues**: Critical CVEs in base image or dependencies

**Deployment Failed**:
- **Where**: ArgoCD UI → Application → Events
- **How**: Check sync status and pod events
- **Common Issues**: Image pull errors, insufficient resources, configuration errors

**Application Not Responding**:
- **Where**: Kubernetes pod logs, Grafana dashboards
- **How**: `kubectl logs <pod-name>` or Backstage component view
- **Common Issues**: Application crashes, database connection failures, port misconfigurations

## 5. Knowledge Check (5 minutes)

### Quiz: First Deployment Mastery

**Instructions**: Answer all 10 questions. You need 8/10 (80%) to pass. Unlimited attempts allowed.

#### Question 1
**What triggers a Jenkins build in the Fawkes platform?**

- [ ] A) Manual button click in Backstage
- [x] B) Git webhook when code is pushed
- [ ] C) Scheduled cron job every hour
- [ ] D) ArgoCD detecting a configuration change

**Explanation**: When you push code to Git, a **webhook automatically triggers Jenkins** to start the CI/CD pipeline. This ensures every code change is built and tested.

---

#### Question 2
**In which component is your container image stored after the build?**

- [ ] A) Jenkins
- [x] B) Harbor
- [ ] C) ArgoCD
- [ ] D) Kubernetes

**Explanation**: **Harbor** is the container registry where Docker images are stored after Jenkins builds them. Harbor also scans images for vulnerabilities.

---

#### Question 3
**What does ArgoCD do in the deployment pipeline?**

- [ ] A) Builds the container image
- [ ] B) Runs unit tests
- [x] C) Deploys applications to Kubernetes using GitOps
- [ ] D) Scans code for security vulnerabilities

**Explanation**: **ArgoCD implements GitOps**—it continuously monitors Git repositories and ensures Kubernetes cluster state matches the desired state defined in Git.

---

#### Question 4
**What is a "golden path template" in Fawkes?**

- [ ] A) The fastest route to production
- [x] B) A pre-configured application scaffold with best practices built-in
- [ ] C) A deployment checklist
- [ ] D) A security policy document

**Explanation**: **Golden path templates** are pre-built application templates that include everything needed for CI/CD, monitoring, and deployment—so you can start from a working example.

---

#### Question 5
**When is the "lead time for changes" measurement started?**

- [x] A) When code is committed to Git
- [ ] B) When Jenkins build starts
- [ ] C) When ArgoCD begins syncing
- [ ] D) When pods become ready

**Explanation**: Lead time starts at the **Git commit timestamp** and ends when the deployment completes. This measures how long code waits in your process.

---

#### Question 6
**What does it mean when ArgoCD shows "Out of Sync"?**

- [ ] A) The application is broken
- [ ] B) Jenkins build failed
- [x] C) Desired state (Git) differs from actual state (Kubernetes)
- [ ] D) The database is down

**Explanation**: "Out of Sync" means **Git has changes that aren't yet applied to Kubernetes**. ArgoCD will automatically sync, or you can trigger it manually.

---

#### Question 7
**How can you verify your application is healthy after deployment?**

- [ ] A) Check if ArgoCD shows "Synced"
- [ ] B) Call the application's health endpoint
- [ ] C) Look at pod status in ArgoCD
- [x] D) All of the above

**Explanation**: You should verify **all three**: ArgoCD sync status, pod health, and application response. A healthy deployment shows green across all checks.

---

#### Question 8
**Where do you find logs if your application crashes after deployment?**

- [ ] A) Jenkins build logs
- [ ] B) Harbor scan results
- [x] C) Kubernetes pod logs (via ArgoCD or kubectl)
- [ ] D) Git commit history

**Explanation**: **Pod logs** show application runtime errors. Access them via ArgoCD UI → click pod → "Logs", or use `kubectl logs <pod-name>`.

---

#### Question 9
**What does Jenkins do during the "Security Scan" stage?**

- [ ] A) Tests application functionality
- [x] B) Scans container image for known vulnerabilities
- [ ] C) Checks code style
- [ ] D) Deploys to production

**Explanation**: Jenkins uses **Trivy to scan container images** for CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) in base images and dependencies.

---

#### Question 10
**Why does the same container image move through all environments (dev → staging → prod)?**

- [ ] A) To save disk space
- [ ] B) To make builds faster
- [x] C) To ensure consistency—what you test is what you deploy
- [ ] D) It's a Fawkes requirement, not a best practice

**Explanation**: **Immutable deployments** mean the exact same artifact (container image) progresses through environments. You never rebuild for production—you promote the tested image.

---
