## Vision & Philosophy

### The Problem

Platform engineering skills are in high demand but difficult to acquire:

- **Theory vs. Practice Gap**: Reading about platform engineering ≠ doing platform engineering
- **No Safe Practice Environment**: Production is too risky, toy examples aren't realistic
- **Fragmented Learning**: Scattered blog posts, docs, and courses don't provide cohesive journey
- **No Feedback Loops**: Hard to know if you're improving or building bad habits
- **Lack of Recognition**: No clear progression system or credentials

### The Fawkes Dojo Solution

> **"Learn platform engineering by building and operating a real platform"**

The Fawkes Dojo is not a traditional course or documentation site. It's an **immersive learning environment** where:

1. ✅ **Learn by Doing**: Every concept practiced immediately in production-like environment
2. ✅ **Safe to Fail**: Isolated environments where mistakes are learning opportunities
3. ✅ **Immediate Feedback**: Automated validation, metrics, and mentor review
4. ✅ **Progressive Mastery**: Clear belt system showing skill progression
5. ✅ **Real Tools, Real Skills**: Same tools used in production environments
6. ✅ **Community Learning**: Learn with peers, share achievements, get help
7. ✅ **Recognized Credentials**: Earn badges/certificates valued by employers

### Learning Philosophy

#### 1. **Production-First Learning**

- Labs use the actual Fawkes platform, not simplified versions
- Same tools, same workflows, same challenges as production
- Mistakes have consequences (within safe boundaries)
- Build muscle memory for real-world scenarios

#### 2. **Immediate Application**

- Maximum 5 minutes of theory before hands-on practice
- Every concept demonstrated, then practiced
- Build, break, fix—the fastest path to mastery

#### 3. **Spaced Repetition & Reinforcement**

- Concepts introduced multiple times in increasing complexity
- Earlier skills reinforced in advanced modules
- Regular reviews and retrospectives

#### 4. **Deliberate Practice**

- Focused on specific skills with clear goals
- Challenging but achievable (flow state)
- Immediate feedback on performance
- Reflection on what worked and what didn't

#### 5. **Social Learning**

- Learn with cohorts (optional but encouraged)
- Share solutions and approaches
- Peer code review and feedback
- Celebrate achievements publicly

### Lab Provisioning Process

1. **Learner Enrolls in Module**:

   ```
   User clicks "Start Lab" in Backstage
       ↓
   Dojo Provisioner API called
       ↓
   Creates namespace: dojo-learner-{username}
       ↓
   Applies resource quotas and RBAC
       ↓
   Deploys lab-specific resources
       ↓
   Returns access credentials and instructions
       ↓
   Lab environment ready in <2 minutes
   ```

2. **Lab Execution**:

   ```
   Learner follows lab instructions
       ↓
   Makes changes in their namespace
       ↓
   Lab Validator monitors progress
       ↓
   Checkpoints automatically verified
       ↓
   Feedback provided in real-time
       ↓
   Final submission auto-graded
   ```

3. **Lab Cleanup**:
   ```
   Lab completed or 24-hour timeout
       ↓
   Namespace marked for deletion
       ↓
   Grace period: 1 hour (allow review)
       ↓
   Namespace and resources deleted
       ↓
   Results stored in database
   ```

### Lab Validation System

**Automated Validation Types**:

- **Resource Existence**: Deployment, Service, Ingress created
- **Configuration Correctness**: Labels, annotations, replicas match spec
- **Health Status**: Pods running, services responding
- **Security Compliance**: No privileged containers, security contexts set
- **Performance**: Response time, resource usage within limits
- **DORA Metrics**: Deployment recorded, metrics updated

**Example Validation (Lab: Deploy First App)**:

```yaml
validations:
  - name: "Deployment exists"
    type: "resource-exists"
    resource: "deployment/sample-app"
    points: 10

  - name: "Service responds"
    type: "http-check"
    url: "http://sample-app.{namespace}.svc.cluster.local"
    expected_status: 200
    points: 15

  - name: "DORA metric recorded"
