# Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for Fawkes platform-specific terms, concepts, and acronyms.

## A

### ArgoCD
GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Monitors Git repositories and automatically syncs application state to the cluster.

### Application Catalog
Central registry of all applications and services managed by the Fawkes platform, stored in Backstage.

## B

### Backstage
Developer portal that provides a unified interface for platform services, documentation, and software catalog.

### BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)
Testing methodology using Gherkin syntax to describe system behavior in plain language.

### Buildpack
Cloud Native Buildpacks technology that transforms application source code into OCI images without requiring a Dockerfile.

## C

### ClusterPolicy
Kyverno policy resource that applies validation, mutation, or generation rules cluster-wide across all namespaces.

### CRD (Custom Resource Definition)
Kubernetes extension mechanism that allows defining custom resource types beyond built-in objects.

### Crossplane
Infrastructure-as-code tool that extends Kubernetes to manage cloud resources using declarative YAML.

## D

### DevLake (Apache DevLake)
Data platform for collecting and analyzing DORA metrics from multiple sources (Jenkins, GitHub, etc.).

### Devfile
YAML specification that defines development environment configuration for Eclipse Che workspaces.

### DORA Metrics
Four key metrics measuring software delivery performance: Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Changes, Change Failure Rate, Time to Restore Service.

## E

### Eclipse Che
Cloud-based IDE providing containerized development environments defined by Devfiles.

### External Secrets Operator
Kubernetes operator that synchronizes secrets from external secret management systems (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) into Kubernetes Secrets.

## F

### Fawkes
Internal Developer Platform (IDP) for elite software delivery performance. Integrates GitOps, CI/CD, observability, and learning.

### Focalboard
Open-source project management tool integrated into the Fawkes platform for sprint planning and tracking.

## G

### GitOps
Operational framework using Git as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications.

### Golden Path
Standardized, opinionated CI/CD pipeline enforcing best practices for build, test, security scanning, and deployment.

### Grafana
Visualization and analytics platform for metrics, logs, and traces.

## I

### IDP (Internal Developer Platform)
Self-service platform abstracting infrastructure complexity and providing standardized workflows for developers.

### Ignite
Bootstrap script (`ignite.sh`) for initializing the Fawkes platform in a new environment.

## J

### JCasC (Jenkins Configuration as Code)
Plugin allowing Jenkins configuration to be defined in YAML rather than manual UI setup.

## K

### Kustomize
Kubernetes configuration management tool using overlays to customize base manifests for different environments.

### Kyverno
Kubernetes-native policy engine for validation, mutation, and generation of resources.

## M

### Mattermost
Open-source team collaboration platform integrated into Fawkes for ChatOps and notifications.

## O

### OpenSearch
Distributed search and analytics engine used for centralized logging in Fawkes.

### OpenTelemetry (OTel)
Vendor-neutral observability framework for generating and collecting telemetry data (traces, metrics, logs).

## P

### Pod Security Standards
Kubernetes security policies defining privilege levels: Privileged, Baseline, Restricted.

### PolicyReport
Custom resource generated by Kyverno containing audit results of policy evaluations.

### Prometheus
Time-series database and monitoring system for collecting and querying metrics.

## S

### SonarQube
Static application security testing (SAST) platform analyzing code quality and security vulnerabilities.

### Starter Project
Pre-configured template repository referenced in a Devfile for bootstrapping new applications.

## T

### Tempo (Grafana Tempo)
Distributed tracing backend storing and querying OpenTelemetry traces.

### Trivy
Container image and filesystem vulnerability scanner.

### Trunk-Based Development
Source control branching model where developers work on a single main branch with short-lived feature branches.

## V

### Vault (HashiCorp Vault)
Secrets management system providing secure storage and access control for sensitive data.

### Vault Agent
Sidecar container that automatically retrieves secrets from Vault and injects them into application pods.

## Y

### YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)
Human-readable data serialization language used throughout Kubernetes and Fawkes configurations.
