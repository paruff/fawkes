# PURPOSE: Example Certificate resource for automatic TLS certificate management
#          This demonstrates how to request certificates for your services
# ============================================================================

# Example: Single domain certificate
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: jenkins-tls
  namespace: fawkes
  labels:
    app: jenkins
    component: security
spec:
  # Secret name where the certificate will be stored
  secretName: jenkins-tls

  # Certificate duration (default: 90 days)
  duration: 2160h # 90 days

  # Renew certificate before expiration
  renewBefore: 360h # 15 days

  # Subject configuration
  subject:
    organizations:
      - Fawkes Platform

  # Common name
  commonName: jenkins.fawkes.yourdomain.com

  # DNS names for the certificate
  dnsNames:
    - jenkins.fawkes.yourdomain.com

  # Reference to ClusterIssuer
  issuerRef:
    name: letsencrypt-prod
    kind: ClusterIssuer

# Example: Wildcard certificate (requires DNS-01 challenge)
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:

    app: platform
    component: security

    organizations:
      - Fawkes Platform

  commonName: "*.fawkes.yourdomain.com"

  # Wildcard DNS name
  dnsNames:
    - "*.fawkes.yourdomain.com"

  # Must use DNS-01 challenge for wildcard certificates

# Example: Multiple domains certificate
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:

  namespace: fawkes

    app: platform
    component: security
spec:

      - Fawkes Platform

  # Multiple DNS names in one certificate
  dnsNames:

# NOTE: To use certificates in Ingress resources, add:
# spec:
#   tls:
#     - hosts:
#         - jenkins.fawkes.yourdomain.com
#       secretName: jenkins-tls
#
# Or use cert-manager annotations for automatic certificate creation:
# metadata:
#   annotations:
#     cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
