# PURPOSE: ExternalSecret to pull ArgoCD admin credentials from secret manager
#          via External Secrets Operator.
# USAGE: Configure Vault/AWS Secrets Manager/Azure Key Vault with these secrets:
#        - argocd/admin (property: password)
# NOTE: ArgoCD expects the secret to be named 'argocd-initial-admin-secret'
#       with a 'password' key containing the bcrypt-hashed password.
#       For plain-text password storage, ArgoCD will hash it on startup.
